                        <div class="subtopic-description">At least seven DOJ officials resigned in 36 hours after being ordered to dismiss corruption charges against NYC Mayor Eric Adams. Acting U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon and Acting Public Integrity Section head John Keller both resigned rather than comply. In resignation letters, prosecutors described a quid pro quo where Adams would help Trump's immigration enforcement in exchange for dropped charges. Assistant U.S. Attorney Hagan Scotten wrote: "I expect you will eventually find someone who is enough of a fool, or enough of a coward, to file your motion. But it was never going to be me." The event has been dubbed the "Thursday Night Massacre" or "Valentine's Day Seven," echoing Nixon's Saturday Night Massacre.</div>

                        <div class="subtopic-description">As of May 2025, 70% of Civil Rights Division lawyers had left through quits, deferred resignation programs, or early retirements. Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon stated her vision to "turn the train around and drive it in the opposite direction," shelving the division's traditional mission. Attorneys were forced onto task forces focused on Trump priorities like antisemitism and transgender issues. The administration dropped investigations and withdrew statements in approximately 30 cases. Current and former officials describe this as "the dismantling of the civil rights division."</div>

This occurred while Congress authorized hiring 100 new judges to address a 3.4 million case backlog. DOJ is training hundreds of military lawyers without immigration law backgrounds to serve temporarily as judges. Defendants increasingly fail to appear at court due to fear of ICE detention in hallways.</div>

Former officials stated the firings were designed to "intimidate the Justice Department and FBI workforce and deter investigations of Trump's second administration." Senior career officials handling national security threats, from terrorist plots to Chinese cyberattacks, were removed or reassigned. One former FBI official asked: "Is anyone in DOJ or FBI really going to investigate that now?"</div>

One prosecutor told colleagues continuing would "violate their ethical responsibilities." Over 30 subpoenas were issued targeting former CIA Director John Brennan, FBI agents Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. U.S. Attorney Jason Reding Quiñones held an emergency meeting as the atmosphere became "pins and needles."</div>

                        <div class="subtopic-description">Trump's defense of H-1B visas during a November interview with Laura Ingraham sparked outrage from MAGA supporters. His statement that America doesn't have people with "certain talents" contradicted his America First base. Prominent supporters including Marjorie Taylor Greene, Jack Posobiec, Kevin Sorbo, and Laura Loomer publicly criticized the position, creating one of the first major MAGA splits since the 2024 election.</div>

Key emails included: Epstein calling Trump "the dog that hasn't barked" and claiming Trump spent "hours at my house" with an alleged victim (2011); Epstein writing that Trump "knew about the girls as he asked Ghislaine to stop" (2019); and Epstein telling Lawrence Summers "I have met some very bad people, none as bad as Trump" (2017).</div>
