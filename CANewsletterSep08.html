                                <p>Our country embarked on an interesting experiment when it elected as president a second-rank NYC real estate developer who excelled mostly in branding, but with no governmental experience, scant knowledge of history and no interest in public policy. Covid aside, we survived his first term without too much damage and our democracy remained mostly intact in the wake of the Trump-inspired post-2020 election shenanigans. Now that he has been elected for a second term (Grover Cleveland style) and most guardrails have been removed by Trump's sycophantic appointees and a compliant Congress and Supreme Court, it remains to be seen how things will play out, but warning lights are flashing.</p>

                                <h4><em>Trump's Drivers</em></h4>

                                <p>As the son of a highly successful, unethical and demanding father, Trump was desperate to please, he sought mentorship from the ruthless family lawyer/adviser Roy Cohn. Among the pearls of wisdom he imparted to Trump were "Don't ever admit guilt", "The court of public opinion is more important than the court of law" (per Cohn's cousin) and when attacked, to eschew diplomacy or negotiation but hit back ten times harder. Although probably unaware of its source, UCLA football coach Red Blake in 1950, Trump clearly subscribes to a "Winning isn't everything; it is the only thing" ethos.</p>

                                <h4><em>Political Application of Trump's Drivers</em></h4>

                                <p>During the 2016 campaign, Trump repeatedly said "We're going to win so much, you may even get tired of winning". Then in 2024, he promised "to lead America to new heights of greatness like the world has never seen before" (Ed. note: the Greek, Persian, Roman, Mongol, Ottoman and British Empires say "Hi"; apparently Trump is unaware of the concept of hubris.). And now he says of the alleged economic growth due to his policies "we've never seen anything like it before", and commented more broadly "No president has ever achieved so much in so little time".</p>

                                <h4><em>Trump Administration Scorecard</em></h4>

                                    <li>Friday's job report indicated only 22k new jobs in August vs. an expected 75k new jobs; a loss of 13k jobs in July—the first loss since 12/20 and the job growth in the last three months is only at one third the level of last year's; the loss of 12k manufacturing jobs in August and 78k year-to-date; an increase in the unemployment rate to 4.3%, the highest level since October 2021.
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>As a result of all of the above, for the first time in four years there are fewer open jobs than job seekers.</li>
                                            <li>Claudia Sahm, Chief Economist for New Century Advisors commented "At this point, the job market is at stall speed".</li>
                                            <li>Per Pew, 1.2 MM immigrants dropped out of the labor force during the first seven months of this year. Immigrants account for 20% of the U.S. workforce, including 45% of employees in farming, fishing and forestry and 43% of home health aides. Collectively immigrants have accounted for 50% of U.S. job growth. Many of these jobs cannot readily be filled by non-immigrants.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>The annual inflation rate stayed at 2.7% in July; this compares to the 2.4% annual rate in September 2024 and released in October lambasted by Trump and the key driver of his subsequent election victory.</li>
                                    <li>After experiencing 2.8% growth in 2024, Deloitte projects that the U.S. economy will grow by only 1.4% this year.</li>
                                    <li>Lurking over all of this, Trump's efforts to assert dominance over the Federal Reserve was characterized by Paul Krugman as being a "Wile E. Coyote moment".</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>Let's turn to the foreign policy arena:</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>During the campaign, Trump said that he could end the war in Ukraine during his first day in office. He also foresaw no difficulty in ending the war in Gaza. No end is near in either theater.
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>With regard to Trump's apparent deference to Putin, Tom Nichols wrote "this is a classic moment where it's understandable to ask: If the Russians owned him, how would his actions be any different?".</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Desperate to win the Nobel Peace Prize, Trump claims that he has ended as many as ten wars, three of which he said hadn't even started.</li>
                                    <li>One of these wars is this year's Kashmir-based India/Pakistan conflict, where the U.S. played a minimal role at best in resolving it, but Pakistan said they would nominate Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. Trump's taking credit greatly antagonized fellow authoritarian Narendra Modi who has long cultivated a reputation for being tough on Pakistan. When Modi stopped returning Trump's calls, he retaliated by increasing India's tariff rate from 25% to 50%, purportedly because of their purchases of Russian oil. India, the world's most populous country with the fifth largest economy and our tenth biggest trade partner, responded when Modi attended a meeting with Xi and Putin in Tianjin last weekend, his first trip to China in seven years.</li>
                                    <li>Although NATO countries have stepped up their financial commitment to defense spending, our relationship with them has been fraying as they look to become more self-reliant and find new trade partners.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h4><em>Public Polling</em></h4>

                                <p>The NBC News Decision Desk poll of 30k adults released today, Sunday, indicated the following with regard to Trump's approval rating in several categories:</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Overall: 43/57% (NYT poll aggregate is 43/52%)</li>
                                    <li>Economy: 39/61%</li>
                                    <li>Inflation: 39/61%</li>
                                    <li>Trade/Tariffs: 41/59%</li>
                                    <li>Deportations: 43/57%</li>
                                    <li>Immigration: 47/53% (Border Security)</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>When asked to name the issue most important to them, 25% of respondents chose the Economy, 24% Threats to Democracy, 17% Health Care, 12% Crime/Safety, 9% Immigration, and 13% all other issues.</p>

                                <p>In other polls out this week, WSJ/NORC polling found only 33/67% approval for the BBB, and Reuters/IPSOS found that only 38% of respondents supported the use of troops to police D.C..</p>

                                <h4><strong>What Trump Is Likely to Do</strong></h4>

                                <p>Given his win-at-all-costs ethos, Trump is laser-focused on retaining Republican control of Congress in the 2026 election and the White House in 2028. To this end, he is calling for Republican gerrymanders wherever possible and the reduction or elimination of mail-in voting. In addition, he is disparaging voting machines, supporting voter suppression, and encouraging Republicans to take over election administration whenever possible.</p>

                                <p>However it is also necessary for Trump to develop an issue-based campaign strategy. Given that the economic numbers have been unfavorable and are likely to get worse as the tariffs are increasingly passed onto consumers, it is becoming clear that Trump will turn to other issues. These are likely to include an intense focus on crime, illegal immigration, muscular national defense, demonizing the Democrats and transgender and other social issues.</p>

                                <p>The news of this week serves as an indicator of the administration's political direction:</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Speaking plainly, Trump said "I think crime will be a key subject of the midterms" and the next (presidential) election".</li>
                                    <li>After declaring D.C. "SAFE AGAIN", the planning is well underway for a military incursion into Chicago which Trump characterized as "the worst and most dangerous city in the world by far" and suggested that Baltimore and New Orleans (in a red state, but with a Democratic mayor) are also high on the list.
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Governor JB Pritzker trenchantly responded "Donald Trump isn't a strongman, he's a scared man. Illinois won't be intimidated by a wannabe dictator".</li>
                                            <li>D.C. has the 10th highest crime rate, Baltimore ranks 3rd and Chicago and New Orleans are outside of the top 10; high ranked red state cities including #1 Memphis, #4 Kansas City MO, #7 Houston and #8 Nashville have not even been referenced.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>On the immigration front:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>An ICE raid on a Hyundai-LG automotive battery plant in Ellabell, GA, which involved 500 law enforcement officers, resulted in 475 arrests of mostly undocumented South Koreans. The plant manufactured batteries for electric vehicles and was expected to produce 8,500 jobs in this rural area.</li>
                                            <li>The administration plans to reopen three prison facilities in GA, KS and TX which were closed during the Biden administration because of excessive violence and mistreatment of prisoners. The prisons will be used to house ICE detainees and will presumably be funded from the $45 B in the BBB to expand ICE detention facilities. The administration has already authorized a new ICE detention center with a capacity of over 400 men within the notorious Angola penitentiary in Louisiana.</li>
                                            <li>The DOJ is suing Boston for sanctuary city policies which "interfere with the federal government's enforcement of its immigration laws".</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>With regard to national defense:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Trump signed an EO to rename the Department of Defense as the Department of War, reversing the name change in 1949 under the National Security Act. In the EO, he characterized the change as a "signal to adversaries of America's readiness to wage war to serve its interests".
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li>This runs counter to Trump's long-held aspirations to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. Perhaps it is a reflection of his feckless efforts to stop the wars in Ukraine and Gaza and marks a shift toward striving for the (non-existent) Nobel <em>War</em> Prize.</li>
                                                </ul>
                                            </li>
                                            <li>U.S. aircraft blew up a Venezuelan speedboat in international waters, killing all 11 alleged Tren de Aragua drug smugglers on board. Although Trump claimed that the boat was delivering a massive cocaine shipment to America, Marco Rubio later acknowledged that it may have been bound for Trinidad and could have been interdicted. it is highly questionable that this action was legal. Former DoD lawyer Ryan Goodman wrote "I literally cannot imagine lawyers coming up with a legal basis for a lethal strike of a suspected Venezuelan drug boat". In addition, two destroyers have been dispatched to the Caribbean as part of our counternarcotics operation.</li>
                                            <li>In a reference to the iconic 1979 film <em>Apocalypse Now,</em> a post on Truth Social showed an image of Trump with the juxtaposed text "I love the smell of deportations in the morning...Chicago is about to find out why it's called the Department of War", succinctly touching upon Trump's main political themes going forward.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Leveraging the Minneapolis Catholic school shootings carried out by a transgender woman, the DOJ is considering a rule which could bar transgender individuals from purchasing firearms. There is no data which indicates that transgender people are more likely to commit acts of violence than the general population. In fact, they are more likely to be the victims of gun violence.</li>
                                    <li>Turning to the economy, Trump said "If you took away tariffs, we could end up being a Third World country".</li>
                                    <li>Turning to the Jeffrey Epstein controversy, Trump described calls for the release of the files as a "DEMOCRAT Hoax...in order to <strong>d</strong>eflect and <strong>d</strong>istract from the great success of a Republican president.", neatly accusing them of using elements of his <strong>4D</strong> strategy I like to reference.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h4><strong>Weekly Update on RFK Jr.'s Stewardship of the Department of Health and Human Services</strong></h4>

                                <p>It would be remiss not to discuss RFK Jr's contentious hearing before the Senate Finance Committee this week in the wake of the firing of CDC Director Susan Monarez. Before I get to that, however, I was struck by how dark-complected the Irish-American Kennedy has become. In June, he was spotted surreptitiously leaving a D.C. tanning salon where presumably he is a regular. It occurs to me that Kennedy and Trump may have bonded over their tanning activities, the dark brown versus orange coloration notwithstanding.</p>

                                <p>We all know that Kennedy has been a long-time vaccine skeptic, and this week it came out that he was concerned about a connection between Tylenol use during pregnancy and autism. He also suggested that the Biden-era expansion of access to mifepristone might be cut back because they "twisted the data", even though it has been safely in use in the U.S. for 25 years and longer in Europe. In this context, let me suggest that a better use of HHS resources might be to conduct a study of a possible connection between the use of tanning facilities and failing cognition and declining emotional health.</p>

                                <p>Prior to the hearing, CDC Directors from eight consecutive presidential administrations starting with Jimmy Carter's wrote an Op-ed in the NYT entitled "We Ran the CDC, Kennedy is Endangering Every American's Health". The next day more than 1000 current and former HHS employees signed a letter demanding that RFK Jr. resign.</p>

                                <p>Turning to the hearing itself, Kennedy was grilled, not only by the Committee's Democrats, but also by the two Republicans who were physicians, John Barrasso and Bill Cassidy. Kennedy remained combative and didactic throughout and conceded nothing. Here are a few of his remarks:</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Even though in questioning from Senator Cassidy he agreed that Trump deserved a Nobel Prize for Operation Warp Speed, Kennedy went on to say that the "CDC failed...miserably during Covid".</li>
                                    <li>He referred to himself as "the busiest, most proactive" leader in the history of HHS.</li>
                                    <li>He described the recent staff shake-up as "absolutely necessary adjustments" to restore to the position of global leadership in fighting infectious diseases and said that deposed Director Susan Monarez was a liar.</li>
                                    <li>Kennedy said that he fired the entire Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices because of their "conflicts of interest".</li>
                                    <li>When asked by Senator Mark Warner (D-VA) if he accepted that a million Americans died from Covid (actually over 1.2 MM), Kennedy responded "I don't know how many died, I don't think anyone knows". When asked by the senator if he believed if the vaccines had prevented Covid deaths, he equivocated.</li>
                                    <li>When asked by Senator Maggie Hassan about the restrictions on the availability of Covid vaccines for children, Kennedy responded "This is crazy talk. You're just making stuff up".</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>Taken together, these were astonishing remarks and the term "Luddite" comes to mind, but unlike RFK Jr., the 19th-century textile workers deserve some sympathy because they were reacting to the imminent loss of their jobs because of automation.</p>

                                <p>In trying to thread the needle between taking credit for the vaccines and not antagonizing his base, Trump remarked on Truth Social "It is very important that the Drug Companies justify the success of their various Covid Drugs. Many people think that they are miracles that saved Millions of lives. Others disagree. I want the answer and I want it now".</p>

                                <p>We should bear in mind that a CDC study last year found that between 1994 and 2023, childhood vaccinations prevented 32 MM hospitalizations and 1.1 MM deaths, saving $540 B directly and generating overall societal savings of $2.7 T.</p>
