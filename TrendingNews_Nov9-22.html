                        <div class="subtopic-description">Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene announced on Friday, November 21, that she would resign from Congress effective January 5, 2026, after Trump called her a "traitor" and withdrew his endorsement. In an 11-minute video statement, Greene blamed Trump's scorn on the Epstein files issue and excoriated the Republican Party for being "cast aside by MAGA Inc and replaced by Neocons, Big Pharma, Big Tech, Military Industrial War Complex." She refused to be a "battered wife" and stated she had "too much self-respect and dignity" to endure a primary against her. Greene did not give Speaker Johnson advance notice, and her resignation will shrink the GOP House majority to just 218 seats. Rep. Thomas Massie expressed support, writing "I'm very sad for our country but so happy for my friend Marjorie."</div>

                        <div class="subtopic-description">After years as one of Trump's strongest defenders, Greene became one of his biggest critics over issues including the Epstein files, H-1B visas, foreign policy, healthcare, and tariffs. Trump branded her "wacky" and said he would endorse a challenger when she ran for reelection. When asked about her resignation, Trump told reporters, "I think it's great news for the country. It's great." Greene suggested Republicans will lose the 2026 midterms and Trump will be impeached when Democrats regain control.</div>

The split between tech billionaires (Musk, Thiel) who support H-1B visas and the America First base who oppose them remained unresolved. Similarly, divisions over Israel policy between pro-Israel Republicans and anti-Israel America First voices persisted.</div>

                        <div class="subtopic-description">Greene's announcement came as the Republican Party faced defeats in November elections up and down the ballot, with Democrats winning key state and local races where affordability was a central issue. This added to the sense of fracture within Trump's coalition.</div>

However, she conceded her resignation might end not only her congressional career but also her role in MAGA entirely.</div>

China suspended export controls on rare earths (gallium, germanium, antimony, graphite), resumed purchasing U.S. agricultural products (12 million metric tons of soybeans in late 2025, 25 MMT annually 2026-2028), and suspended all retaliatory tariffs. The U.S. lowered fentanyl-related tariffs by 10 percentage points and maintained the suspension of heightened reciprocal tariffs. China also removed sanctions on various shipping entities and agreed to resume trade from Nexperia's facilities for critical legacy chips.</div>

                        <div class="subtopic-description">Building on earlier rollbacks, Trump expanded tariff breaks on Brazilian goods including additional agricultural products. The November 13 executive order removed reciprocal tariffs from certain qualifying agricultural products not grown in sufficient quantities in the U.S. Trump cited substantial progress in trade negotiations (9 framework deals, 2 final agreements, 2 investment agreements) as justification. The U.S. and Switzerland agreed to lower Swiss import tariffs to 15% from 39%.</div>

                        <div class="subtopic-description">On November 9 and throughout the period, Trump floated issuing $2,000 "tariff dividends" to middle and lower-income Americans, funded by tariff revenue. He suggested checks would come "probably in the middle of next year, a little bit later than that." Budget experts noted the plan would cost $600 billion while tariffs only bring in $200-300 billion annually. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated Congress would need to approve the plan. Trump acknowledged US consumers are "paying something" for his tariffs.</div>

Federal Reserve Chair Powell noted "tariff-induced inflation will take a long time to become clear." Japan's economic growth contracted 1.8% annually in Q3 2025 due to Trump's tariffs hitting exports. The Tax Policy Center estimated tariffs would impose an average burden of $2,600 per household in 2026.</div>

                        <div class="subtopic-description">On Sunday November 16, Trump reversed course and urged House Republicans to "vote to release the Epstein files, because we have nothing to hide, and it's time to move on from this Democrat Hoax." His reversal came after it became clear the vote would succeed. Trump told reporters on Monday he would sign the bill, saying "I'm all for it" but maintained it was a "hoax" and Democrats were trying to "detract" from Republican success.</div>

                        <div class="subtopic-description">The House voted 427-1 to pass the Epstein Files Transparency Act, with only Rep. Clay Higgins (R-LA) voting against. The discharge petition succeeded after Rep. Adelita Grijalva (D-AZ) became the decisive 218th signature following the end of the government shutdown. About a dozen Epstein survivors, including Virginia Giuffre's brother, watched from the gallery. Speaker Mike Johnson voted yes despite calling it a "political exercise" with "serious deficiencies."</div>

                        <div class="subtopic-description">Less than three hours after the House vote, the Senate unanimously agreed to pass the measure without a formal vote. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer offered a motion to pass the legislation as soon as received from the House; no senators objected. Senate Majority Leader John Thune said the House's 427-1 vote convinced them to move quickly, concluding "the bill was sufficient to accomplish what needed to be done."</div>

                        <div class="subtopic-description">The Epstein Files Transparency Act requires the DOJ to publicly release all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials related to Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell within 30 days of Trump's signature. The bill includes exceptions for survivors' personal information and child sexual abuse material. It covers individuals named or referenced in connection with Epstein's criminal activities, civil settlements, immunity, plea agreements, or investigatory proceedings.</div>

                        <div class="subtopic-description">Epstein survivors spoke outside the Capitol urging lawmakers to vote yes, with several criticizing Trump for politicizing their fight for justice. The bipartisan effort was led by Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) and Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA), with crucial support from Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. Trump does not need legislation to release the files and could order their release immediately. A White House official confirmed Trump will sign the bill "whenever it gets to the White House," though major loopholes may delay actual releases.</div>

                        <div class="subtopic-description">Following the November 5 oral arguments in Learning Resources v. Trump, the Supreme Court is expected to issue a decision by year-end. The justices from both conservative and liberal wings expressed skepticism about Trump's authority under IEEPA to impose tariffs. The case remains the most consequential pending decision affecting Trump's tariff policy, with potentially "catastrophic consequences" for the administration if ruled against, according to Solicitor General D. John Sauer.</div>

                        <div class="subtopic-description">If the Supreme Court rules against Trump's IEEPA tariffs, experts expect the administration will seek alternative methods to carry out the trade agenda using other statutory authorities. Georgetown Law Professor Kathleen Claussen noted Trump "could piece together something very close to — if not identical to — what he's done so far" using powers explicitly granted by Congress.</div>

The measure was largely symbolic as the House blocked tariff-related measures from floor consideration under a new rule.</div>
