                <div class="observation">
                    <strong>John's Analysis:</strong> Unlike oil that requires tankers and electricity that has transmission line losses, data centers can be located anywhere because information flows at the speed of light. This flexibility makes concentrated policy for geothermal-powered data centers very sensible.

                    <h4>Hal's Key Insight on Geothermal</h4>
                    Geothermal energy isn't as location-dependent as traditionally thought—it's more about drilling depth than geography. Even Virginia and Massachusetts could access geothermal through deeper drilling, making the ongoing operational benefits substantial.
                </div>
                
                <div class="quote">
                    <strong>Hal:</strong> "Look, all the energy companies are going to be against it, and et cetera, et cetera, we know all that, but I still think it's a point of discussion."
                </div>
                
                <div class="observation">
                    <strong>John's Response:</strong> Solar energy has similar locational flexibility for data centers—they could be set up where there's abundant sunshine, like Arizona. However, Hal notes solar is intermittent unlike geothermal.

                    John notes the collision between free enterprise zealots who "just want to go, go, go" without government encumbrance, and the need for coordinated long-term policy thinking about energy infrastructure.
