                            On January 30, 2026, former CNN anchor Don Lemon was arrested in Beverly Hills by federal agents and charged with conspiracy against religious freedom and violations of the FACE Act (Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances) in connection with his coverage of an anti-ICE protest at Cities Church in St. Paul, Minnesota on January 18. Independent journalist Georgia Fort was also arrested at her home in Minneapolis as her three daughters watched. Attorney General Pam Bondi personally directed the arrests.

Lemon and Fort were among dozens of people who entered the church; both maintained they were there as journalists documenting the event. Fort told NBC that armed federal agents surrounded her home at 6 a.m. while her children slept.

The DOJ then appealed to the Chief Judge of the U.S. District Court in Minnesota, who also declined. An appeal to the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals was similarly denied. Only after three courts rejected the case did prosecutors secure an indictment through a grand jury.

His attorney, Abbe Lowell, called the arrest "this unprecedented attack on the First Amendment." The Committee to Protect Journalists condemned the arrest as something that "should alarm all Americans."

                            Nekima Levy-Armstrong, a prominent Minneapolis civil rights leader also arrested in connection with the church protest, had her booking photograph manipulated before being distributed through White House social media channels.

The manipulated image was viewed millions of times before being identified as altered.

                            A Washington Post investigative piece highlighted the Trump administration's use of administrative subpoenas — which are not court orders — to circumvent constitutional protections.

                            The Texas Democratic primary for U.S. Senate features two candidates widely regarded as rising stars: U.S. Representative Jasmine Crockett of Dallas and state Representative James Talarico of Austin. The winner will face the Republican nominee — likely incumbent Senator John Cornyn or Attorney General Ken Paxton — in November, seeking to flip a seat no Democrat has won statewide since 1994.

Talarico, a former middle school teacher and Presbyterian seminarian, flipped a Trump district to win his Texas House seat and campaigns on cross-partisan appeal to independents and disaffected Republicans.

The result represented a staggering 31-point swing from the 2024 presidential results, in which Trump carried the district by 17 points.

Markey would be 80 before the start of another six-year term if reelected.
