        <h1>The Neville Chamberlain Peace Prize</h1>
        
        <p class="lede">Finally, finally, President Trump just might get a peace prize that would secure his place in history. Unfortunately, though, it is not that Nobel peace prize he so covets. It is the "Neville Chamberlain Peace Prize" — awarded by history to the leader of the country that most flagrantly sells out its allies and its values to an aggressive dictator.</p>
        
        <p>This prize richly deserves to be shared by Trump's many "secretaries of state" — Steve Witkoff, Marco Rubio and Dan Driscoll — who together negotiated the surrender of Ukraine to Vladimir Putin's demands without consulting Ukraine or our European allies in advance — and then told Ukraine it had to accept the plan by Thanksgiving.</p>
        
        <p><strong>That is this coming Thursday.</strong></p>
        
        <p>If Ukraine is, indeed, forced to surrender to the specific terms of this "deal" by then, Thanksgiving will no longer be an American holiday. It will become a Russian holiday. It will become a day of thanks that victory in Putin's savage and misbegotten war against Ukraine's people, which has been an utter failure — morally, militarily, diplomatically and economically — was delivered to Russia not by the superiority of its arms or the virtue of its claims, but by an American administration.</p>
        
        <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-size: 1.2em; color: #666; margin: 30px 0;">How do you say "Thanksgiving" in Russian?</p>
        
        <div class="names-box">
            <h3>A Message to Those Who Delivered This Deal:</h3>
            <p>To all the gentlemen who delivered this turkey to Moscow, I can offer only one piece of advice: <strong>Be under no illusions.</strong> Neither Fox News nor the White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt will be writing the history of this deal.</p>
            <div class="names-list">
                Donald Trump<br>
                Steve Witkoff<br>
                Marco Rubio<br>
                Dan Driscoll
            </div>
            <p style="margin-top: 15px; font-style: italic;">Every one of your names will live in infamy alongside that of Chamberlain.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="chamberlain-reference">
            <h3>Historical Context: Neville Chamberlain</h3>
            <p>He was the British prime minister who advocated the policy of appeasement, which aimed to avoid war with Adolf Hitler's Germany by giving in to his demands. This was concretized in the 1938 Munich Agreement, in which Chamberlain, along with others in Europe, allowed Germany to annex parts of Czechoslovakia. Chamberlain boasted it would secure "peace for our time." A year later, Poland was invaded, starting World War II and leading to Chamberlain's resignation — and his everlasting shame.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>This Trump plan, if implemented, will do the modern equivalent. By rewarding Putin's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine based on his obsession with making it part of Mother Russia, the U.S. will be putting the whole European Union under Putin's thumb. Trump's message to our allies will be clear: Don't provoke Putin, because as long as I am commander in chief, the United States will pay no price and we will bear no burden in the defense of your freedom.</p>
        
        <p>Which is why, if this plan is forced on Ukraine as is, we will need to add a new verb to the diplomatic lexicon: <span class="new-verb">"Trumped"</span> — to be sold out by an American president, for reasons none of his citizens understand (but surely there are reasons). And history will never forget the men who did it — Donald Trump, Steve Witkoff, Marco Rubio, Dan Driscoll — for their shame will be everlasting.</p>
        
        <div class="wsj-quote">
            "Mr. Trump may figure he can finally wash his hands of Ukraine if Europe and Ukraine reject his offer. He's clearly sick of dealing with the war. But appeasing Mr. Putin would haunt the rest of his presidency. If Mr. Trump thinks American voters hate war, wait until he learns how much they hate dishonor. … A bad deal in Ukraine would broadcast to U.S. enemies that they can seize what they want with force or nuclear blackmail or by pressing on until America loses interest."
        </div>
        
        <p>Mind you, I am not at all against a negotiated solution. Indeed, from the beginning of this war I have made the point that it will end only with a "dirty deal." But it cannot be a filthy deal, and the Trump plan is what history will call a filthy deal.</p>
        
        <p>Even before you get to the key details, think of how absurd it is for Trump to strike a deal with Putin and not even include Ukraine and our European allies in the negotiations until they were virtually done. Trump then declared it must be accepted by Thursday, as if Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, who has a parliament that he needs to win acceptance from, could possibly do so by then, even if he wanted to.</p>
        
        <p>As my Times colleague David Sanger observed in his analysis of the plan's content: "Many of the 28 points in the proposed Russia-Ukraine peace plan offered by the White House read like they had been drafted in the Kremlin. They reflect almost all Mr. Putin's maximalist demands."</p>
        
        <div class="key-terms">
            <h3>Key Terms of the Trump Plan</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Territory:</strong> Ukraine must formally give Russia all territory it has declared for itself in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk regions, with U.S. recognition</li>
                <li><strong>NATO:</strong> No NATO forces could be based inside Ukraine</li>
                <li><strong>Military Limits:</strong> Ukrainian military capped at 600,000 troops (25% cut from current levels)</li>
                <li><strong>Weapons Ban:</strong> Ukraine barred from possessing long-range weapons that could reach Russia</li>
                <li><strong>Security Guarantees:</strong> Vague guarantees from the U.S. against Russian re-invasion (from Trump?)</li>
                <li><strong>Financial Terms:</strong> $100 billion in frozen Russian assets toward rebuilding Ukraine, with the U.S. receiving 50% of profits</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <p>Trump, facing blowback from allies, Congress and Ukraine, said Saturday that this was not his "final offer" but added, if Zelensky refuses to accept the terms, "then he can continue to fight his little heart out." As always with Trump, he is all over the place — and as always, ready to stick it to Zelensky, the guy fighting for his country's freedom, and never to Putin, the guy trying to take Ukraine's freedom away.</p>

                <h3>✓ An Acceptable "Dirty Deal"</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Freeze forces in place, never formally cede Ukrainian territory</li>
                    <li>European security forces (backed by U.S. logistics) stationed along cease-fire line as tripwire</li>
                    <li>Russia pays significant reparations for carnage inflicted</li>
                    <li>Moscow remains isolated and under sanctions until it pays</li>

                <h3>✗ The Current "Filthy Deal"</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Using U.S. leverage only on Ukraine, not on Russia</li>
                    <li>Folding an imperfect hand to a Russian leader playing a terrible one</li>
                    <li>Negotiated without Ukraine or European allies</li>
                    <li>Reflects Putin's maximalist demands</li>
                    <li>Rewards aggression and unprovoked invasion</li>

                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <p>This would be a dirty deal that history would praise Trump for — getting the best out of a less than perfect hand, by using U.S. leverage on both sides, as he did in Gaza.</p>
        
        <p class="conclusion">But just using U.S. leverage on Ukraine is a filthy deal — folding our imperfect hand to a Russian leader who is playing a terrible one.</p>
