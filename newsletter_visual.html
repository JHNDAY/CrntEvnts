                <p>President Trump's massive "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," signed into law on July 4th, is already wreaking havoc on healthcare facilities nationwide as providers brace for devastating cuts to Medicaid and ACA subsidies. The bill is projected to strip health insurance from 17 million people over the next decade, with the Congressional Budget Office estimating 11.8 million people will lose Medicaid coverage between now and 2034, while another 4.2 million will lose ACA subsidies. Healthcare providers from Sharp Healthcare in San Diego to rural hospitals in Missouri are already announcing layoffs and service cuts, with New York alone facing an estimated $8 billion in cuts to hospitals and health systems, leading to 34,000 lost hospital jobs and an additional 29,000 related job losses.</p>

            <div class="section-content">
                <p>President Trump dramatically escalated his global tariff campaign during the week, announcing 30% tariffs on Mexico and the European Union starting August 1st, while also threatening 35% tariffs on Canada and confirming 50% copper tariffs. Trump made the announcements with separate letters he posted on Truth Social to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, threatening to upend the global economy if he actually implements the new tariffs. The moves came as Wall Street traders continued to share the accusation that "Trump Always Chickens Out," prompting Trump to falsely insist that he did not delay a tariff deadline despite repeatedly pushing back implementation dates. The stock market has learned to love President Donald Trump's tariffs, with the S&P 500 gaining 26 percent since early April despite initial volatility over trade policy uncertainty.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>With the 2026 midterm elections just 16 months away, Republican strategists are increasingly concerned that Trump's "Big Beautiful Bill" could prove politically costly as its effects ripple through healthcare and social services. Political scientists warn that "The Big Beautiful Bill could prove costly to the Republican Party if the promised tax cut benefits are not felt universally," with millions of poorer Americans‚Äîmany in the MAGA camp‚Äîlikely to see their benefits cut. Despite these concerns, recent polling from Verasight shows Republicans maintaining confidence in retaining both chambers, though analysts note that "quite a lot of the electoral game is still left to play in the next year and a half". As of July 2025, a total of 16 representatives (7 Democrats and 9 Republicans) have announced their retirement, with 13 retiring to run for other offices, setting up competitive races across the country.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>Political scientists are sounding increasingly urgent alarms about the trajectory of American democracy as Trump's second term unfolds, with experts warning that "the United States is governed nationally by a party with greater will and power to exploit constitutional and legal ambiguities for authoritarian ends than at any time in the past two centuries". Foreign Affairs analysis suggests that "competitive authoritarianism will transform political life in the United States," noting that "Democratic Party donors may be targeted by the IRS; businesses that fund civil rights groups may face heightened tax and legal scrutiny". The concerns come as two studies released this week by Freedom House and the Economist Intelligence Unit found international democracy in retreat, with the quality of democracy in 130 of 167 countries either worsening or making no improvement. Trump's early presidency has been marked by "a steady stream of changes to and strains on institutions," though experts note it may be "too early for Americans to project where things are headed".</p>

            </div>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>President Trump's relationship with Vladimir Putin appeared to reach a breaking point this week as the administration announced a dramatic reversal in Ukraine policy, combining increased weapons shipments with new economic threats against Russia. Trump laid out "a pair of steps intended to pressure Russia to end its war in Ukraine, including funneling new weapons to Kyiv and threatening economic punishment on Moscow if peace isn't reached in 50 days, as he grows increasingly disenchanted with his Russian counterpart". The shift came after audio revealed Trump claimed he once told Putin "If you go into Ukraine, I'm going to bomb the shit out of Moscow," though Putin reportedly only "believed me 10%". Trump expressed his newfound frustration publicly, saying "My conversations with him are very pleasant, and then the missiles go off at night," while denying he fell into Putin's trap like previous presidents. The Ukraine pivot represents a major foreign policy recalibration as analysts note the Trump administration has "wrought chaos around the world and weakened the United States' place in it" during its first 100 days.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>The American healthcare system is experiencing immediate disruption from Trump's legislative agenda, with providers across the country already announcing closures and layoffs in anticipation of massive Medicaid cuts. Families like Courtney Leader's, whose 9-year-old daughter with brain damage and cerebral palsy relies on Medicaid benefits for daily care, are watching the debate with particular urgency, with Leader saying "This is not a luxury...I have my daughter enrolled in Medicaid so we can keep her alive". Rural hospitals are particularly vulnerable, with one-third of all rural hospitals already at risk of closing due to financial difficulties, and the new cuts potentially leading to the loss of nearly 500,000 health care jobs over the next decade. The crisis extends beyond insurance coverage, as the Trump administration slashed the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality on April 1, firing roughly half of its remaining employees as part of a reorganization of the Health and Human Services Department, eliminating a key organization focused on patient safety research.</p>
