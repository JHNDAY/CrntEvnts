            <h1>Trump and His Administration Are Becoming Tired of Winning</h1>
            <div class="subtitle">Commentary by George Model<br>Sep 1 - Sep 7, 2025</div>
        </div>

        <p>Our country embarked on an interesting experiment when it elected as president a second-rank NYC real estate developer who excelled mostly in branding, but with no governmental experience, scant knowledge of history and no interest in public policy. Covid aside, we survived his first term without too much damage and our democracy remained mostly intact in the wake of the Trump-inspired post-2020 election shenanigans. Now that he has been elected for a second term (Grover Cleveland style) and most guardrails have been removed by Trump's sycophantic appointees and a compliant Congress and Supreme Court, it remains to be seen how things will play out, but warning lights are flashing.</p>

        <h2>Trump's Drivers</h2>
        <p>As the son of a highly successful, unethical and demanding father, Trump was desperate to please, he sought mentorship from the ruthless family lawyer/adviser Roy Cohn. Among the pearls of wisdom he imparted to Trump were <span class="emphasis">"Don't ever admit guilt"</span>, <span class="emphasis">"The court of public opinion is more important than the court of law"</span> (per Cohn's cousin) and when attacked, to eschew diplomacy or negotiation but hit back ten times harder. Although probably unaware of its source, UCLA football coach Red Blake in 1950, Trump clearly subscribes to a <span class="emphasis">"Winning isn't everything; it is the only thing"</span> ethos.</p>

        <h2>Political Application of Trump's Drivers</h2>
        <p>During the 2016 campaign, Trump repeatedly said <span class="emphasis">"We're going to win so much, you may even get tired of winning"</span>. Then in 2024, he promised <span class="emphasis">"to lead America to new heights of greatness like the world has never seen before"</span> (Ed. note: the Greek, Persian, Roman, Mongol, Ottoman and British Empires say "Hi"; apparently Trump is unaware of the concept of hubris.). And now he says of the alleged economic growth due to his policies <span class="emphasis">"we've never seen anything like it before"</span>, and commented more broadly <span class="emphasis">"No president has ever achieved so much in so little time"</span>.</p>

        <h3>Economic Performance</h3>
        <div class="stats-grid">

            </div>
        </div>

        <ul>
            <li>Friday's job report indicated only 22k new jobs in August vs. an expected 75k new jobs; a loss of 13k jobs in July—the first loss since 12/20 and the job growth in the last three months is only at one third the level of last year's</li>
            <li>The loss of 12k manufacturing jobs in August and 78k year-to-date; an increase in the unemployment rate to 4.3%, the highest level since October 2021</li>
            <li>As a result of all of the above, for the first time in four years there are fewer open jobs than job seekers</li>
        </ul>

            <strong>Claudia Sahm, Chief Economist for New Century Advisors:</strong> "At this point, the job market is at stall speed"
        </div>

        <p>Per Pew, 1.2 MM immigrants dropped out of the labor force during the first seven months of this year. Immigrants account for 20% of the U.S. workforce, including 45% of employees in farming, fishing and forestry and 43% of home health aides. Collectively immigrants have accounted for 50% of U.S. job growth. Many of these jobs cannot readily be filled by non-immigrants.</p>

        <h3>Foreign Policy Challenges</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>During the campaign, Trump said that he could end the war in Ukraine during his first day in office. He also foresaw no difficulty in ending the war in Gaza. No end is near in either theater</li>
            <li>With regard to Trump's apparent deference to Putin, Tom Nichols wrote <span class="emphasis">"this is a classic moment where it's understandable to ask: If the Russians owned him, how would his actions be any different?"</span></li>
            <li>Desperate to win the Nobel Peace Prize, Trump claims that he has ended as many as ten wars, three of which he said hadn't even started</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <strong>India Relations Crisis:</strong> Trump's taking credit for Kashmir peace greatly antagonized fellow authoritarian Narendra Modi. When Modi stopped returning Trump's calls, he retaliated by increasing India's tariff rate from 25% to 50%. India responded when Modi attended a meeting with Xi and Putin in Tianjin last weekend, his first trip to China in seven years.

        <div class="section-divider"></div>

        <h2>What Trump Is Likely to Do</h2>
        <p>Given his win-at-all-costs ethos, Trump is laser-focused on retaining Republican control of Congress in the 2026 election and the White House in 2028. To this end, he is calling for Republican gerrymanders wherever possible and the reduction or elimination of mail-in voting.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <h3>Political Strategy Shift</h3>
            <p>Given that the economic numbers have been unfavorable and are likely to get worse as the tariffs are increasingly passed onto consumers, it is becoming clear that Trump will turn to other issues. These are likely to include an intense focus on crime, illegal immigration, muscular national defense, demonizing the Democrats and transgender and other social issues.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Recent Administration Actions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Crime Focus:</strong> Trump said "I think crime will be a key subject of the midterms" and planning is underway for a military incursion into Chicago, characterized as "the worst and most dangerous city in the world by far"</li>
            <li><strong>Immigration Enforcement:</strong> An ICE raid on a Hyundai-LG automotive battery plant resulted in 475 arrests of mostly undocumented South Koreans</li>
            <li><strong>Military Posture:</strong> Trump signed an EO to rename the Department of Defense as the Department of War, signaling "America's readiness to wage war to serve its interests"</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="quote">
            <strong>Governor JB Pritzker's Response:</strong> "Donald Trump isn't a strongman, he's a scared man. Illinois won't be intimidated by a wannabe dictator"

        <div class="section-divider"></div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <h2>Weekly Update on RFK Jr.'s Stewardship of HHS</h2>
            <p>RFK Jr. faced contentious hearings this week following the firing of CDC Director Susan Monarez. His combative performance included denying the known Covid death toll and firing the entire Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for "conflicts of interest."</p>
        </div>

        <ul>
            <li>Kennedy described himself as "the busiest, most proactive" leader in HHS history</li>
            <li>When asked if he accepted that a million Americans died from Covid, Kennedy responded "I don't know how many died, I don't think anyone knows"</li>
            <li>CDC Directors from eight consecutive administrations wrote an op-ed entitled "We Ran the CDC, Kennedy is Endangering Every American's Health"</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <strong>Important Context:</strong> A CDC study last year found that between 1994 and 2023, childhood vaccinations prevented 32 MM hospitalizations and 1.1 MM deaths, saving $540 B directly and generating overall societal savings of $2.7 T.
