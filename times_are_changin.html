        They told us the old order was returning. They promised a new "Golden Age." But here we are, one year in, and the waters are rising. The Authoritarian Project promised efficiency and strength. The American Democratic Project? Well, it turns out it had some fight left in it after all.

    <summary>Come writers and critics who prophesize with your pen</summary>
    
    <p>Let's start with the courts, shall we? Because nothing says "popular mandate" quite like <span class="stat">530 lawsuits</span> filed against your administration in your first year. That's not a typo. <span class="stat">Five hundred and thirty.</span> To put that in perspective, Biden faced fewer than 50 in his first 100 days. Obama? About 30. But Trump's second act? He's shattered all records.</p>
    
    <p class="citation">(<a href="https://thefulcrum.us/rule-of-law/supreme-court-rulings-2025" target="_blank">The Fulcrum, November 19, 2025</a>)</p>
    
    <p>And here's the kicker: of the 32 cases fully adjudicated by May, Trump lost 24 of them. Courts have issued <span class="stat">over 200 orders</span> stopping his administration's actions. Federal judges—including ones he appointed—keep putting the brakes on this runaway train.</p>
    
    <p class="citation">(<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2025-lawsuits-against-trump-administration/" target="_blank">Bloomberg, May 8, 2025</a>)</p>
    
    <p><span class="dylan-voice">The wheel's still in spin, and the judges ain't having it.</span> Twenty-two states, led by New York's Letitia James, sued over the federal grant freeze. California's Attorney General Rob Bonta has filed <span class="stat">54 lawsuits</span> with "resounding success"—securing 12 final rulings, 35 preliminary injunctions, and watching the administration back down entirely in six cases rather than defend their "illegal actions" in court.</p>

    <p>The Supreme Court? Even they're getting tired of it. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson voted against the administration in <span class="stat">every single one</span> of 24 emergency docket cases. Chief Justice Roberts joined the liberal justices in dissent on funding terminations. When you've lost John Roberts...</p>

    <p>And the bleeding hasn't stopped. By early 2026, Bloomberg News found that judges had halted Trump's funding cuts in <span class="stat">more than half of 167 spending fights</span>—or the government backed down after being sued. The administration keeps swinging, and the courts keep blocking. On February 12th, four states sued to stop Trump from withholding <span class="stat">$600 million</span> in public health grants. The same day, environmental groups prepared lawsuits over the EPA's rollback of greenhouse gas regulations. On February 13th, the Justice Department filed yet another lawsuit against Harvard—this time demanding seven years of admissions data—even as two previous Harvard lawsuits against the administration wind through appeals.</p>

    <summary>Come senators, congressmen, please heed the call</summary>
    
    <p>But forget the courts for a moment. Let's talk about the streets. Because while the lawyers file motions, the people have been marching.</p>
    
    <p>February 5, 2025: The <span class="stat">50501 movement</span> (50 protests, 50 states, one day) draws thousands to state capitols nationwide. February 17: "Not My President's Day" rallies multiply. April 5: The <span class="stat">Hands Off protests</span> become the largest single-day rally with over <span class="stat">1,400 events</span> in all 50 states, drawing an estimated <span class="stat">three to five million participants</span>. That's bigger than anything in Trump's first term.</p>
    
    <p class="citation">(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hands_Off_protests" target="_blank">Wikipedia, "Hands Off protests"</a>; <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/19/nx-s1-5369483/anti-trump-protests-50501-tesla-takedown" target="_blank">NPR, April 20, 2025</a>)</p>
    
    <p>June 14: The <span class="stat">No Kings protests</span>—reportedly the largest day of protest in U.S. history—spread across the nation on Trump's 79th birthday. Not exactly the party he was hoping for.</p>
    
    <p class="citation">(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50501_movement" target="_blank">Wikipedia, "50501 movement"</a>)</p>
    
    <p><span class="dylan-voice">And you better start swimmin' or you'll sink like a stone.</span> Here's what's different from 2017: these protests are reaching deep into Trump country. Professor Erica Chenoweth's research shows protests are now appearing in counties that voted overwhelmingly for Trump. In his first term, the average was 40 protesters per 10,000 people in Trump counties. Now? <span class="stat">65 per 10,000.</span> They're peaceful, persistent, and they're everywhere.</p>
    
    <p class="citation">(<a href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty-research/policy-topics/advocacy-social-movements/anti-trump-protests-are-making-headway" target="_blank">Harvard Kennedy School, October 2025</a>)</p>

    <p>But perhaps nothing crystallized the resistance quite like Minneapolis in January 2026. First came Renée Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, fatally shot by an ICE agent on January 7th. Then Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse, killed by Border Patrol agents on January 25th. Video evidence disputed the official narrative that Pretti had approached agents with a gun—it showed him holding a cellphone, his legally-permitted firearm still holstered at his waist.</p>

    <p>The city erupted. On January 23rd, <span class="stat">50,000 protesters marched</span> through Minneapolis in freezing temperatures. Hundreds of businesses shut down in a general strike, demanding ICE operations cease within the city. More protests followed on January 26th, with over 300 gathering to show solidarity. The deaths prompted bipartisan calls for Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to resign. Even Trump had to pull Border Patrol agents out of Minnesota and send border czar Tom Homan to replace the commander on the ground—a rare sign the White House was softening its stance amid political fallout.</p>

    <p><span class="dylan-voice">And then the waters rose higher still.</span> By February 4th, Trump withdrew approximately <span class="stat">700 federal immigration agents</span> from Minnesota. On February 12th, Tom Homan announced the administration was ending Operation Metro Surge entirely. The people had marched in freezing cold. The businesses had shut down. The politicians—even some Republicans—had pushed back. And for once, the administration blinked.</p>

    <p><span class="dylan-voice">You better start swimmin'.</span> The organizers behind the No Kings protests shifted their focus to Minneapolis, planning another round of rallies in response to the killings. As one organizer told the press, the deaths of Good and Pretti had "prompted them to shift focus" to a city already on edge. When federal agents shoot American citizens in their own communities, the waters rise fast.</p>

    <p>Then there are the institutions. Harvard University looked at Trump's demands—audit your viewpoints, reduce the power of certain faculty, discontinue DEI—and said something you don't hear much anymore: <span class="dylan-voice">No.</span></p>
    
    <p>President Alan Garber's response was crystal clear: "The University will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights. No government—regardless of which party is in power—should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue."</p>
    
    <p class="citation">(<a href="https://www.harvard.edu/president/news/2025/the-promise-of-american-higher-education/" target="_blank">Harvard University President, April 14, 2025</a>)</p>
    
    <p>The administration froze <span class="stat">$2.2 billion</span> in funding. Harvard sued. And in September, Judge Allison D. Burroughs delivered a scathing 84-page ruling: the administration had used "antisemitism as a smokescreen for a targeted, ideologically-motivated assault on this country's premier universities." The funding was restored.</p>

    <p>But Harvard didn't stand alone. Over <span class="stat">150 university and college presidents</span> signed a statement condemning "unprecedented government overreach." Big Ten faculties approved "mutual-defense compacts." Columbia, after initially caving, reversed course and rejected "heavy-handed orchestration from the government."</p>

    <p>Corporate America? Well, they're scared. But even fear has its limits. Shareholders at Apple, Costco, Coca-Cola, Goldman Sachs, and Berkshire Hathaway <span class="stat">overwhelmingly rejected</span> anti-DEI proposals pushed by conservative activists. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting is suing Trump for trying to fire board members.

    <p>Even the conservative media is starting to crack. The Wall Street Journal, New York Post, and—wait for it—<span class="stat">Fox News</span> have all pushed back on Trump's economic policies. When Rupert Murdoch's empire starts to waver, you know the waters are rising.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, journalism itself is fighting back. The Associated Press sued after being barred from White House events for refusing to call the Gulf of Mexico the "Gulf of America." The New York Times, Reuters, and NPR refused to sign Pentagon documents that would have muzzled their reporting. Despite <span class="stat">170 assaults on journalists</span> by law enforcement in 2025, despite funding cuts and threats, the press keeps reporting.</p>

    <p>And then there are the polls. Oh, the polls. Trump's approval rating sits at a dismal <span class="stat">38-44%</span>, depending on which survey you trust. His <span class="dylan-voice">signature issue</span>—immigration—has crashed to <span class="stat">39% approval</span>, the lowest of his second term. A majority—<span class="stat">58%</span>—say ICE has gone "too far" in enforcement. And those numbers came <span class="dylan-voice">after</span> the fatal shootings in Minneapolis.</p>
    
    <p class="citation">(<a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/president-trump-approval-rating-january-2026" target="_blank">Reuters/Ipsos, January 27, 2026</a>; <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/1/27/trumps-approval-on-immigration-falls-to-record-low-new-poll-finds" target="_blank">Al Jazeera, January 27, 2026</a>)</p>

    <p>The killings of Renée Good and Alex Pretti didn't just spark protests—they moved the numbers. Trump's immigration approval dropped from 41% earlier in January to 39% after the shootings. A Quinnipiac poll found <span class="stat">57% disapproved</span> of how ICE is enforcing immigration laws. Another poll showed <span class="stat">51% said ICE enforcement is making American cities less safe</span>, while only 31% said it's making them safer. When you're killing American citizens in American cities, people notice.</p>

    <p>By early February, the bottom fell out entirely. An AP-NORC poll conducted February 5-8 found Trump at <span class="stat">36% approval, 62% disapproval</span>—a devastating <span class="stat">net -26 points</span>, matching his worst showing in three months. Pew Research, surveying over 8,500 Americans, found just <span class="stat">37% approval</span>, with half the country saying the administration's actions were "worse than expected." Only <span class="stat">27% support</span> all or most of Trump's policies—down from 35% a year earlier. Even among Republicans, confidence in Trump acting ethically dropped from 55% to <span class="stat">42%</span>.</p>

    <p>The economy? <span class="stat">54% say the country is worse off</span> than a year ago. <span class="stat">70% give him negative economic ratings.</span> And <span class="stat">58% say he's gone too far</span> in using presidential power—up from 52% at the start of his term.</p>

    <p>Marjorie Taylor Greene—yes, <span class="stat">that</span> Marjorie Taylor Greene—broke with Trump over the Epstein files, foreign policy, and what she sees as his abandonment of "America First" principles. Trump called her "Wacky Marjorie" and "Marjorie 'Traitor' Green." She responded: "I don't worship or serve Donald Trump. I remain America First and America Only!!!" Then she resigned from Congress.</p>

    <p>Tucker Carlson and Steve Bannon are openly criticizing Trump for spending "too much time on Palestine and not enough on East Palestine, Ohio." The H1-B visa debate split MAGA between Silicon Valley tech bros and the "America First" base.

    <p>When Trump bombed Iran in June, the MAGA movement fractured down the middle—isolationists versus hawks, with Tucker Carlson and Candace Owens leading the opposition.

    <p>Even Ben Shapiro is admitting the emperor has no clothes: "When President Trump says things are becoming more affordable, people don't believe that they are becoming more affordable because they aren't really more affordable."</p>

    <p><span class="dylan-voice">But wait—there's a twist.</span> While MAGA tears itself apart, something curious is happening on the left. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the progressive firebrand who once symbolized the Democratic Party's leftward pull, is doing something unexpected: <span class="stat">building coalitions</span>. She's "teaming with moderate Democrats and even some Republicans on legislation," raising cash for vulnerable Democrats in swing districts, and explicitly rejecting litmus tests. After endorsing progressive Zohran Mamdani for New York City mayor, she told MSNBC: "This is not about progressive issue, it's not moderate, it's not liberal. This is about 'do you understand the assignment of fighting fascism right now?' And the assignment is to come together across difference no matter what."</p>

    <p>Rep. Norma Torres observed: "I've seen a huge change from an activist to a serious legislator." She raised nearly <span class="stat">$24 million</span> in 2025, much of it going to support Democrats across the ideological spectrum. So while Trump's movement splinters over H1B visas and Argentina bailouts, the resistance is learning to work together. <span class="dylan-voice">For the loser now will be later to win.</span></p>

    <summary>The order is rapidly fadin'</summary>
    
    <p><span class="dylan-voice">So here we are, friends.</span> One year into the "Golden Age," and the Authoritarian Project is running into the immovable object of American democracy. Five hundred and thirty lawsuits. Millions in the streets. Harvard standing firm. The AP fighting back. MAGA turning on itself. Approval ratings in the toilet.</p>
    
    <p>And then came February. The Minneapolis uprising forced Trump to end Operation Metro Surge and withdraw 700 agents. His approval crashed to 36%—a net -26 points. Courts continued blocking his funding cuts in case after case. Four more states sued. Harvard got sued again. The BBC lawsuit got a trial date. The resistance didn't fade—it intensified.</p>
    
    <p>Dylan sang about the old order fading in 1964. Sixty years later, it's a different old order trying to reassert itself. But the waters have grown. The people are swimming. And those who thought they could stand still are finding themselves drenched to the bone.</p>
    
    <p>The courts are checking power. The streets are filled with voices. The institutions—battered but not broken—are finding their spine. The polls show a nation unconvinced. And the movement that seemed unstoppable is discovering that coalitions built on personality cults tend to fracture when the personality starts to crack.</p>
    
    <p class="dylan-voice">For the times they are a-changin'.</p>
    
    <p>You better start swimmin'. Or you'll sink like a stone.</p>
