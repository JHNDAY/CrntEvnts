                        <p>The U.S. sanctioned two judges from the International Criminal Court – the latest step in the Trump administration's campaign to punish those involved with efforts to investigate Israel's conduct in Gaza. Judges Gocha Lordkipanidze and Erdenebalsuren Damdin were sanctioned for their involvement in rejecting Israeli legal challenges.</p>

                        <h3>ICC Slams Sanctions as Attack on Judicial Independence</h3>
                        <p>The sanctions make it virtually impossible for judges to hold credit cards, making everyday financial transactions and online purchases difficult. The ICC called the sanctions "a flagrant attack against the independence of an impartial judicial institution" that puts the international legal order at risk.</p>

"States must firmly oppose US threats and sanctions and uphold the court's ability to pursue accountability, even against the most powerful perpetrators."</p>

Washington demands the ICC formally end its probe of US troops in Afghanistan and change its founding statute to ensure it would not pursue prosecution of Trump and his officials.</p>

                        <h3>Trump Not Ruling Out War with Venezuela</h3>
                        <p>President Trump said he is leaving the possibility of a war with Venezuela on the table. "I don't rule it out, no," he told NBC News. Trump ordered a "blockade" of sanctioned oil tankers, and the campaign has resulted in 28 boat strikes killing more than 100 people, including a controversial "double tap" strike.</p>

                        <p>White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles revealed Trump "wants to keep on blowing boats up until Maduro cries uncle" – contradicting public claims that strikes are about stopping drugs. The administration has alternatively pointed to drugs, criminals, oil, and regime change as justifications.</p>

                        <p>After years of shortages and economic collapse, Venezuelans face fresh uncertainty. Many say they're too exhausted to do anything but endure. "It's a lie that the rich will pay the price," one resident said. "We are the ones who always pay."</p>

                        <p>Trump stated his intention is "getting land, oil rights, whatever we had" returned by Venezuela. Under Hugo Chavez, Venezuela nationalized oil fields in 2007, seizing assets from American oil companies. "They took our oil rights," Trump said. "We had a lot of oil there and we want it back."</p>

                        <p>Trump's "America First" supporters don't appear to be breaking with him yet, but analysts say following through on land strikes could change that. "The question that I have is, who is asking for this?" said one conservative foreign policy expert. The campaign has killed at least 98 people with more than 26 boat strikes.</p>

                            <p>In 1995 Rob Reiner directed <em>The American President</em>, written by Aaron Sorkin. The final scene is a meditation on what it means to be the president of the United States.</p>
                            <blockquote>"For the last couple of months, Senator Rumson has suggested that being president of this country was to a certain extent about character. And although I have not been willing to engage in his attacks on me, I've been here three years and three days. And I can tell you, without hesitation, being president of this country is entirely about character."</blockquote>

                            <p>Here is what Trump had to say on Truth Social about the murder of Rob Reiner and his wife:</p>
                            <blockquote>"A very sad thing happened last night in Hollywood. Rob Reiner, a tortured and struggling, but once very talented movie director and comedy star, has passed away, together with his wife, Michele, reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME, sometimes referred to as TDS."</blockquote>

                            <p>It presents a sharp contrast to the anodyne remarks for which Jimmy Kimmel was excoriated after Charlie Kirk's assassination.</p>

He was dressed casually in a hoodie, hat and jeans while most guests were dressed up. He had been staying in the guest house on his parents' property and had a history of drug addiction. He checked into a Santa Monica hotel early Sunday morning, four miles from the Brentwood home.</p>

                            <p>I think John's second revision looks good. Hal, I think that your FROM ALL PARTICIPANTS suggestion might intimidate attendees who are there to listen, but are not confident enough to engage actively.</p>
                            <p>John, since Ukraine is a country and some participants may not relate to Kiev being its capital, perhaps we should change Caracas to Venezuela; if you prefer we could say Caracas to Kiev.</p>
