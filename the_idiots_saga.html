        <p>Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed citizens, and those still clinging to the quaint notion that competence matters in governance—welcome to our performance. Tonight's program features four movements in the ongoing symphony of administrative excellence that is the United States federal government, circa 2026.</p>
        
        <p>Please observe the recurring themes: <em>collateral damage to the innocent</em>, <em>interdepartmental warfare</em>, <em>casual relationship with truth</em>, and <em>the stunning ability to make every situation worse through intervention</em>. The conductor's baton has been replaced with a rubber chicken, but rest assured—the show must go on.</p>

            <div class="act-tagline">"How many more times am I going to be able to do this?"</div>
            
            <div class="act-content">
                <p>Picture this: You're a TSA agent making $36,480 a year, still recovering from last year's 43-day shutdown where you were evicted, couldn't afford gas to get to work, or medicine for your kids. You showed up anyway. You were promised a $10,000 bonus for "exemplary service"—it never came. The rules were never clear. "It's like being in a contest where you don't know the rules," one officer observed.</p>
                
                <p>Now Congress has left town again. The Department of Homeland Security is unfunded—not because of anything you did, but because lawmakers can't agree on immigration policy. Here's the delicious irony: <strong>You work without pay while ICE agents get paid through a separate fund.</strong> The very people whose political battle is causing this shutdown continue to cash their checks while you wonder if you can afford day care.</p>
                
                <div class="the-punchline">
                    "We're never the focus, but we're the ones that are—for lack of a better word—punished, because those on the Hill can't come to an agreement and do their jobs."
                </div>
                
                <p>Oh, and management's brilliant guidance? Stay off social media in uniform. Don't wear your TSA jacket in public—you might be mistaken for ICE. Because nothing says "we value you" like "please don't identify yourself as our employee."</p>

            <div class="act-content">
                <p>An unstoppable force meets an immovable object: The FAA says a new border technology poses "a grave risk of fatalities" to aircraft. The Pentagon says it's "necessary." Neither agency backs down. The solution? <strong>Close El Paso's entire airspace.</strong></p>
                
                <p>Think about the exquisite coordination required to achieve this level of dysfunction. Two federal agencies, ostensibly serving the same government and the same citizens, locked in a stalemate so profound that the only path forward is to shut down a major city's air traffic entirely.</p>
                
                <div class="the-punchline">
                    The FAA and Pentagon couldn't agree on whether saving lives or testing border technology was more important, so they compromised by doing neither effectively while maximizing disruption to everyone else.
                </div>
                
                <p>This is the same Department of Homeland Security, by the way, that oversees the TSA workers from Act I. One might wonder if these people are capable of agreeing on what day of the week it is, let alone coordinating actual security policy.</p>

                <p>In Chicago: Charges dropped after "concerns about evidence." In Minneapolis: Two shootings, both victims labeled terrorists before anyone bothered checking facts. And now, the pièce de résistance: After shooting Hugo Sosa-Celis, agents provided testimony so inconsistent with video footage that prosecutors asked to drop the case entirely.</p>
                
                <div class="the-punchline">
                    "The rush to charge the victim in this case is sadly in line with the administration's never-back-down, more-is-more ethos, and diminishes even further the trust and respect that should or will be granted the government moving forward."

                <p>Two agents now on leave for lying. Maybe facing termination. Possibly prosecution. But hey—the important thing is they rushed to defend the shooting before understanding the facts, right? That's showing leadership! And the third man arrested?

A flight attendant standing on a seat, pleading for everyone to stop fighting while one man holds another in a headlock.</p>
                
                <p>The flight was diverted to Brussels. Two passengers banned for life. The airline vows to "vigorously pursue them to recover costs." But here's what makes it perfect: the behavioral expert notes that attempts to de-escalate "can only make it worse."</p>

                <p>Air rage incidents increased 400% as people returned to flying after pandemic quarantine. Could there be a parallel to citizens' rage after watching their government lurch from crisis to crisis, shutdown to shooting, lie to revision? Surely not. That would be too on-the-nose.</p>

        <h2>🎪 THE FINALE: CURTAIN CALL 🎪</h2>
        <div class="finale-text">
            <p>And so concludes our performance: four tales of a government that punishes its lowest-paid workers for political fights they didn't start, wages interdepartmental warfare while citizens pay the price, lies reflexively when accountability comes calling, and creates chaos that somehow always gets worse when anyone tries to fix it.</p>
            
            <p>The TSA workers will eventually get paid—after missing rent, after the evictions, after going without medicine. The El Paso airspace will presumably reopen—once enough economic damage forces compromise. The ICE agents will maybe face consequences—or maybe just transfers to new positions. And the air rage will continue—because cramped conditions, lack of accountability, and systemic dysfunction have a way of bringing out the worst in everyone.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Ladies and gentlemen, your federal government: Still the greatest show on Earth™, now with 400% more incompetence!</strong></p>
            
            <p>We remind you that this is all perfectly normal. The bumbling team you've witnessed tonight is indeed posing as the governing administration of the greatest country on Earth. Please exit through the gift shop, where you can purchase commemorative shutdown calendars and "I Got Shot by ICE and All I Got Was This T-Shirt" merchandise.</p>
