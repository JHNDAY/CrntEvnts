                <h2>Session Overview</h2>
                <p>This session examined Trump's governance through the lens of performative announcements versus substantive policy, with particular focus on the Minneapolis incident and its national impact. The group explored the growing influence of independent commentators and discussed strategies for accessing diverse perspectives while maintaining critical analysis.</p>
                <p>Key themes included the contrast between announcement-driven governance and actual policy implementation, the intersection of law enforcement and political accountability, and the emerging role of Substack and independent media voices in shaping political discourse.</p>

                                <p>John presented his piece "Governance is the Art of Announcement," explaining how Trump follows one announcement after another, making a big splash, but soon the intended actions are lost and he's on to something else. This pattern is constantly visible in what he does, including the recent investigation of Powell that generated blowback.</p>
                                <p>"He makes this big splash, doesn't think about anything, just puts it out there... that'll just fall into the category of Act 5 of a bad play that he keeps constantly inflicting upon us."</p>

                                <p>George identified two major exceptions to this pattern: "His retribution campaign and internal authoritarianism are unrelenting."</p>

                                <p>John drew a comparison to Emmett Till: "This terrible incident with the murder of the woman in Minneapolis is going to have some real repercussions and blowback.

                                <p>"This murder of this unfortunate woman may fall into that category. Been a lot of protest across the nation."</p>

                                <p>George noted the complexity: "She was middle class and white. They're trying to leverage her being a lesbian as a justification."</p>
                                <p>The recording captured the victim saying to at least one officer: "Hey, I have no problem with you." Her wife's comment was merely "Hey, big boy, why don't you have another sandwich?" After the shooting, one officer said "effing bitch."</p>

                                <p>Ronald highlighted the investigation focus: "They're saying they have to investigate her, the late woman, her wife. Not the officer, but the widow."</p>
                                <p>John noted the consequences: "As a result of that, 6 people in DOJ have resigned."</p>

                                <p>John introduced the section: "I started about a week or couple weeks ago this section called Commentators of Note. And it seems to be growing. The attempt here is simply to make what these authors write accessible and visible to us."</p>
                                <p>The portal gives links to recent articles from featured commentators like Jennifer Rubin, does comparative analysis of five commentators, and talks about what they focus on, how they approach stories, and why this is a good mix.</p>

                                <p>George added: "Jennifer Rubin used to be an old-school conservative back in a more reasonable time. We don't really have a conservative voice in today's parlance.
