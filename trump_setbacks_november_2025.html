            <p class="subtitle">Trump Administration — October/November 2025</p>
            
            <p class="intro">
                The past month has delivered a series of substantial setbacks across electoral, legal, economic, and internal fronts, signaling growing resistance to the administration's expansive exercise of executive power.
            </p>
            
            <h2>MAGA Movement Fractures: Epstein Files & MTG</h2>
            <div class="setback-item featured">
                <strong>Epstein Files Forced Reversal:</strong> After months of blocking release, Trump was forced to sign the Epstein Files bill on Nov. 19 under bipartisan pressure. Emails revealed Epstein claimed Trump <span class="highlight">"knew about the girls"</span> and spent hours with a victim at Epstein's home. Analysts call this "the most significant crack in the MAGA movement's foundation." Americans disapproved 3-to-1; 77% wanted full release.
            </div>
            <div class="setback-item featured">
                <strong>MTG Resignation:</strong> Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene — once Trump's fiercest ally — announced her resignation (effective Jan. 5) after Trump called her a <span class="highlight">"traitor"</span> and "lunatic" for demanding the Epstein files. She refused to be a "battered wife" and said Trump's attacks "put my life in danger."
            </div>
            
            <h2>Legal Challenges & Retribution Campaign Collapse</h2>
            <div class="setback-item breaking">
                <strong>Comey & Letitia James Cases Dismissed (Nov. 24):</strong> Federal Judge Currie threw out both indictments, ruling Trump's hand-picked prosecutor Lindsey Halligan was <span class="highlight">unlawfully appointed</span>. Comey called it "prosecution based on malevolence and incompetence." The statute of limitations has passed for Comey's charges. A "stunning rebuke" of Trump's retribution campaign.
            </div>
            <div class="setback-item">
                <strong>Broader Court Losses:</strong> Trump has lost <span class="stat-box">72%</span> of rulings from Republican-appointed judges, <span class="stat-box">80%</span> from Democratic appointees. Multiple courts blocked immigration, SNAP, and passport policies.
            </div>
            
            <h2>Electoral Repudiation</h2>
            <div class="setback-item">
                <strong>November 4 Sweep:</strong> Democrats won Virginia (Spanberger +14.6 pts), New Jersey (Sherrill +13 pts), NYC (Mamdani), and California's Prop 50. Exit polls: two-thirds said Trump <span class="highlight">failed on inflation promises</span>. Hispanic voters swung back 2-to-1.
            </div>
            
            <h2>Declining Public Support</h2>
            <div class="setback-item">
                <strong>Approval Collapse:</strong> Dropped to <span class="stat-box">36% AP-NORC</span> and <span class="stat-box">41% Emerson</span>. Federal government handling fell from 43% (March) to 33%. Economy rating hit <span class="highlight">lowest since February 2017</span>. Republican approval of Trump down 12 points.
            </div>
            
            <h2>Shutdown, Tariffs & International Isolation</h2>
            <div class="setback-item">
                <strong>43-Day Shutdown:</strong> Longest in U.S. history ended Nov. 12 only after Democratic concessions extracted. Congressional approval collapsed to 15%.
            </div>
            <div class="setback-item">
                <strong>Tariff Vulnerability:</strong> During Nov. 5 Supreme Court arguments, <span class="highlight">both conservative and liberal justices</span> sharply questioned IEEPA tariff authority. Lower courts unanimously ruled tariffs exceeded authority.
            </div>
            <div class="setback-item">
                <strong>Five Eyes Rupture:</strong> UK stopped sharing drug-trafficking intelligence over "illegal" U.S. strikes. Netherlands scaled back over "politicization" fears.

            <p class="subtitle">How Setbacks May Discourage Executive Overreach</p>
            
            <p class="intro">
                These accumulated setbacks create structural barriers and political disincentives that could discourage pursuit of the most expansive unitary executive and authoritarian ambitions.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Retribution Through DOJ Blocked</h2>
            <div class="implication-item breaking">
                <strong>Weaponization Rejected:</strong> The Comey/James dismissals demonstrate courts will not permit the DOJ to be used as a <span class="highlight">political weapon</span>. Trump publicly ordered Bondi to prosecute his enemies "NOW!!!" — then installed an unqualified loyalist to do it. The judiciary called it "unlawful exercises of executive power." This creates precedent blocking future politically-motivated prosecutions rushed through improper channels.
            </div>
            
            <h2>Base Loyalty No Longer Unconditional</h2>
            <div class="implication-item featured">
                <strong>Epstein Precedent:</strong> For the first time, Trump's base defied him on a core issue. The MAGA movement that overlooked "coarseness, indictments, retribution, and self-enrichment" drew a line at the Epstein files. This proves <span class="highlight">even loyal supporters have limits</span>. MTG's break gives permission structure for others to dissent.
            </div>
            
            <h2>Electoral Accountability Restored</h2>
            <div class="implication-item">
                <strong>2026 Warning:</strong> The Democratic sweep demonstrates voters punish overreach at the ballot box. With narrow congressional margins, further extremism risks <span class="highlight">catastrophic 2018-style losses</span>. MTG warned Republicans will lose the House and Trump faces impeachment.
            </div>
            
            <h2>Internal Coalition Fragmenting</h2>
            <div class="implication-item">
                <strong>MAGA Civil War:</strong> Greene's criticism that Trump's policies are <span class="highlight">"not America First"</span> — on H-1B visas, foreign policy focus, and cost-of-living "gaslighting" — echoes broader base frustration. The Epstein files "ripped MAGA apart."
            </div>
            
            <h2>Judicial Independence Resilient</h2>
            <div class="implication-item">
                <strong>Courts as Check:</strong> The 72% loss rate among Republican judges shows ideological allies reject clear overreach. Judge Currie (Clinton appointee) and Judge Boasberg continue enforcing constitutional limits despite Trump's calls for impeachment. Attacks on judges have made them <span class="highlight">less willing to defer</span> to government arguments.
            </div>
            
            <h2>Congressional Resistance Emerging</h2>
            <div class="implication-item">
                <strong>Bipartisan Defiance:</strong> The Epstein files bill passed with overwhelming bipartisan support despite White House lobbying. Career DOJ prosecutors resisted the Comey/James cases. As 2026 approaches, more Republicans calculate that <span class="highlight">distancing from Trump</span> is politically safer.
            </div>
            
            <div class="conclusion">
                <div class="conclusion-title">⚖️ The Path Forward</div>
                The collapse of the Comey/James prosecutions, the Epstein files reversal, and MTG's resignation represent inflection points. Courts are blocking weaponization of DOJ. Trump's base defied him for the first time. Combined with election losses and sinking approval, these developments suggest the unitary executive project faces mounting headwinds. The machinery of authoritarianism is encountering structural resistance.
