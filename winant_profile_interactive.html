                    <p>John Gilbert Winant was born into comfortable circumstances on New York City's fashionable East Side in 1889, the son of a prosperous real estate partner. His path might easily have led to a life of privilege and detachment from the struggles of ordinary Americans. Instead, Winant chose a different course—one that would make him, in the words of his contemporaries, "a man who truly loved mankind."</p>
                    
                    <p>Educated at St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire, Winant attended Princeton University but left without graduating—too restless and impractical for conventional academic success. He returned to St. Paul's as a history teacher, where the rector recognized in him "a great and rare gift of influencing boys along the very highest paths."</p>
                    
                    <p>When America entered World War I, Winant enlisted in the American Expeditionary Forces and served as a pilot in the 8th Aero Squadron, rising to the rank of Captain. He returned to New Hampshire decorated for bravery, but more importantly, transformed by what he had witnessed of human suffering and sacrifice.</p>

                    <p>Winant's political career began in the New Hampshire legislature in 1916, where he immediately marked himself as a leader of the progressive wing of the Republican Party. In an era when child labor remained common, the work week stretched to 55 hours, and women could not vote, the young freshman legislator introduced bills to restrict the workweek for women and children to 48 hours, support universal suffrage, regulate wage standards, and abolish capital punishment.</p>

                    <p>During his three terms as governor (1925-1927 and 1931-1935), Winant pursued an agenda remarkably similar to what Franklin Roosevelt would later call the New Deal. He advanced public works projects, reformed banking laws to protect depositors, restrained the power of railroads, and expanded regulation of utility companies.</p>

He would walk down Concord's streets and when he encountered people who were down-and-out, he would shake their hands, leaving a roll of bills in their palms as he walked away.</p>

                        <h3>Winant's Vision, 1930</h3>
                        <p>"There is want in the land today and men who know the dignity of labor are idle. When we turn into the new year and the sweep of winter winds and hunger and cold crowd in upon many a home, let those of us who plan to take on the duties of office see to it that the stigma of the pauper is never laid upon the consciousness of the willing worker, who asks help for wife and child because the wheels of industry have ceased to turn. We must plan to meet these great cycles of depression and manfully provide against them so that poverty may be no part of modern civilization."</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>Though a loyal Republican, Winant became increasingly sympathetic to the viewpoints of his neighboring governor, Franklin Roosevelt of New York. After FDR's election in 1932, Winant became an early supporter of New Deal programs. Roosevelt called him "Utopian John"—a nickname that captured both affection and recognition of Winant's idealistic nature.</p>

                    <p>In 1935, President Roosevelt asked Winant to become the first chairman of the newly created Social Security Board. FDR wanted a sympathetic Republican to lead the program, emphasizing its non-partisan nature. Winant was ideally suited: a progressive Republican with deep commitment to social justice and an impeccable reputation for integrity.</p>
                    
                    <p>The challenge was immense. They had to create an organization from scratch, establish a nationwide system of offices, design record-keeping systems, and enumerate over 23 million workers—all before payroll tax collections were to begin on January 1, 1937. Under Winant's leadership, working with Arthur Altmeyer and Frank Bane, the Board established 12 regional offices and 77 field offices, created the Social Security number system, and successfully launched the enumeration effort.</p>
                    
                    <p>On the first anniversary of the Social Security Act, Winant declared: "The Social Security Act, in my judgment, is the most humane document written into law in this century."</p>

                The Sacrifice: Resigning to Defend Social Security

                    <p>In 1936, Winant was considered a possible presidential or vice-presidential candidate for the Republican Party. But the Republican nominee that year, Kansas Governor Alf Landon, made opposition to Social Security a centerpiece of his campaign, denouncing it as "unjust, unworkable, stupidly drafted and wastefully financed"—a "fraud on the working man" and a "cruel hoax."</p>
                    
                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        <h3>The Moment of Decision</h3>
                        <p>Winant faced an agonizing choice. As chairman of the Social Security Board, he was expected to remain non-partisan. But as the Board's Republican member, his silence might be taken as agreement with Landon's attacks. His colleagues urged him not to resign. His closest advisers warned it would end his political career. FDR tried to talk him out of it. Winant understood all of this—but felt duty-bound to defend the program he believed would transform American life.</p>

                    <blockquote class="inline-quote">
                        "I am interested in the social security program not from a partisan viewpoint. I am interested in it as a humanitarian measure. Governor Landon has made the problem of social security a major issue in this campaign and I cannot support him. While I retain this position I am not free to defend the Act. Therefore, I am tendering you my resignation."

                    <p>Winant immediately began criss-crossing the country defending Social Security. When the Republican National Committee distributed payroll stuffers designed to frighten workers, Winant went on the radio to denounce them: "Any political message in a worker's pay envelope is coercion. We're supposed to be beyond that in this country."</p>
                    
                    <p>He then publicly endorsed Roosevelt for reelection—a Republican chairman endorsing a Democratic president against his own party's nominee. The Republican Party would never forgive him. Roosevelt won in a landslide. Landon later conceded his attack on Social Security had been a mistake.</p>

                    <p>John Gilbert Winant made three enduring contributions to American life. First, as the founding chairman of Social Security, he helped establish the program that has lifted millions of elderly Americans out of poverty. The reason people born in New Hampshire are assigned Social Security numbers beginning with 001 and 002 is a tribute to Winant's leadership.</p>
                    
                    <p>Second, his principled resignation in 1936 helped protect Social Security at a crucial turning point. By making it impossible for Alf Landon to turn Social Security into a partisan issue, Winant ensured the program would remain a bipartisan commitment for generations.</p>
                    
                    <p>Third, as ambassador during Britain's darkest hours, he personified the bond between the United States and Great Britain. More than any other individual, he made the wartime alliance work.</p>
                    
                    <p>In 2017, New Hampshire erected a bronze statue of Winant on the State Library grounds in Concord.
