                    <div class="content">
                        <p>Over the past few months, President Trump has deployed an imposing military force in the Caribbean to threaten Venezuela. Until now, the president used that force — an aircraft carrier, at least seven other warships, scores of aircraft and 15,000 U.S. troops — for illegal attacks on small boats that he claimed were ferrying drugs. On Saturday, Mr. Trump dramatically escalated his campaign by capturing President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela as part of what he called "a large scale strike" against the country.</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>Few people will feel any sympathy for Mr. Maduro. He is undemocratic and repressive, and has destabilized the Western Hemisphere in recent years. The United Nations recently issued a report detailing more than a decade of killings, torture, sexual violence and arbitrary detention by henchmen against his political opponents. He stole Venezuela's presidential election in 2024. He has fueled economic and political disruption throughout the region by instigating an exodus of nearly eight million migrants.</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>If there is an overriding lesson of American foreign affairs in the past century, however, it is that attempting to oust even the most deplorable regime can make matters worse. The United States spent 20 years failing to create a stable government in Afghanistan and replaced a dictatorship in Libya with a fractured state. The tragic consequences of the 2003 war in Iraq continue to beset America and the Middle East. Perhaps most relevant, the United States has sporadically destabilized Latin American countries, including Chile, Cuba, Guatemala and Nicaragua, by trying to oust a government through force.</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>Mr. Trump has not yet offered a coherent explanation for his actions in Venezuela. He is pushing our country toward an international crisis without valid reasons. If Mr. Trump wants to argue otherwise, the Constitution spells out what he must do: Go to Congress. Without congressional approval, his actions violate U.S. law.</p>
                        <p>The Constitution requires Congress to approve any act of war. Yes, presidents often push the boundaries of this law. But even Mr. Bush sought and received congressional endorsement for his Iraq invasion, and presidents since Mr. Bush have justified their use of drone attacks against terrorist groups and their supporters with a 2001 law that authorized action after the Sept. 11 attacks. Mr. Trump has not even a fig leaf of legal authority for his attacks on Venezuela.</p>

                    <summary>Critique of "Narco-Terrorism" Rationale</summary>
                    <div class="content">
                        <p>The nominal rationale for the administration's military adventurism is to destroy "narco-terrorists." Governments throughout history have labeled the leaders of rival nations as terrorists, seeking to justify military incursions as policing operations. The claim is particularly ludicrous in this case, given that Venezuela is not a meaningful producer of fentanyl or the other drugs that have dominated the recent epidemic of overdoses in the United States, and the cocaine that it does produce flows mostly to Europe. While Mr. Trump has been attacking Venezuelan boats, he also pardoned Juan Orlando Hernández, who ran a sprawling drug operation when he was president of Honduras from 2014 to 2022.</p>

                    <summary>The Monroe Doctrine and "Trump Corollary"</summary>
                    <div class="content">
                        <p>A more plausible explanation for the attacks on Venezuela may instead be found in Mr. Trump's recently released National Security Strategy. It claimed the right to dominate Latin America: "After years of neglect, the United States will reassert and enforce the Monroe Doctrine to restore American pre-eminence in the Western Hemisphere." In what the document called the "Trump Corollary," the administration vowed to redeploy forces from around the world to the region, stop traffickers on the high seas, use lethal force against migrants and drug runners and potentially base more U.S. troops around the region.</p>
                        <p>Venezuela has apparently become the first country subject to this latter-day imperialism, and it represents a dangerous and illegal approach to America's place in the world. By proceeding without any semblance of international legitimacy, valid legal authority or domestic endorsement, Mr. Trump risks providing justification for authoritarians in China, Russia and elsewhere who want to dominate their own neighbors. More immediately, he threatens to replicate the American hubris that led to the invasion of Iraq in 2003.</p>

                    <summary>Trump's Previous Anti-War Statements</summary>
                    <div class="content">
                        <p>As a presidential candidate, Mr. Trump seemed to recognize the problems with military overreach. In 2016, he was the rare Republican politician to call out the folly of President George W. Bush's Iraq war. In 2024, he said: "I'm not going to start a war. I'm going to stop wars."</p>
                        <p>He is now abandoning this principle, and he is doing so illegally.</p>

                <details>
                    <summary>Role of Congressional Oversight</summary>
                    <div class="content">
                        <p>Congressional debates over military action play a crucial democratic role. They check military adventurism by forcing a president to justify his attack plans to the public and requiring members of Congress to tie their own credibility to those plans. For years after the vote on the Iraq war, Democrats who supported Mr. Bush, including Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, paid a political price, while those who criticized the war, like Bernie Sanders and Barack Obama, came to be seen as prophetic.</p>
                        <p>In the case of Venezuela, a congressional debate would expose the thinness of Mr. Trump's rationale. His administration has justified his attacks on the small boats by claiming they pose an immediate threat to the United States. But a wide range of legal and military experts reject the claim, and common sense refutes it, too. An attempt to smuggle drugs into the United States — if, in fact, all the boats were doing so — is not an attempt to overthrow the government or defeat its military.</p>
                        <p>We suspect Mr. Trump has refused to seek congressional approval for his actions partly because he knows that even some Republicans in Congress are deeply skeptical of the direction in which he is leading this country. Already, Senators Rand Paul and Lisa Murkowski and Representatives Don Bacon and Thomas Massie — Republicans all — have backed legislation that would limit Mr. Trump's military actions against Venezuela.</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>A second argument against Mr. Trump's attacks on Venezuela is that they violate international law. By blowing up the small boats that Mr. Trump says are smuggling drugs, he has killed people based on the mere suspicion that they have committed a crime and given them no chance to defend themselves. The Geneva Conventions of 1949 and every subsequent major human rights treaty prohibit such extrajudicial killings. So does U.S. law.</p>
                        <p>The administration appears to have killed defenseless people. In one attack, the Navy fired a second strike against a hobbled boat, about 40 minutes after the first attack, killing two sailors who were clinging to the boat's wreckage and appeared to present no threat. As our colleague David French, a former U.S. Army lawyer, has written, "The thing that separates war from murder is the law."</p>

                        <p>The legal arguments against Mr. Trump's actions are the more important ones, but there is also a cold-eyed realist argument. They are not in America's national security interest. The closest thing to an encouraging analogy is President George H.W. Bush's invasion of Panama 36 years ago last month, which drove the dictator Manuel Noriega from power and helped set Panama on a path toward democracy. Yet Venezuela is different in important ways. Panama is a much smaller country, and it was a country where American officials and troops had operated for decades because of the Panama Canal.</p>

                        <p>The potential for chaos in Venezuela seems much greater. Despite Mr. Maduro's capture, the generals who have enabled his regime will not suddenly vanish. Nor are they likely to hand power to María Corina Machado, the opposition figure whose movement appears to have won the country's most recent election and who accepted the Nobel Peace Prize last month.</p>
                        <p>Among the possible bad outcomes are a surge in violence by the left-wing Colombian military group the ELN, which has a foothold in Venezuela's western area, or by the paramilitary groups known as "colectivos" that have operated on the periphery of power under the Maduro dictatorship. Further unrest in Venezuela could unsettle global energy and food markets and drive more migrants throughout the hemisphere.</p>

                        <p>So how should the United States deal with the continuing problem that Venezuela poses to the region and America's interests? We share the hopes of desperate Venezuelans, some of whom have made a case for intervention. But there are no easy answers. By now, the world should understand the risks of regime change.</p>
                        <p>We will hold out hope that the current crisis will end less badly than we expect. We fear that the result of Mr. Trump's adventurism is increased suffering for Venezuelans, rising regional instability and lasting damage for America's interests around the world.

                    <summary>Victory for American Interests</summary>
                    <div class="content">
                        <p>This is a major victory for American interests. Just hours before, supportive Chinese officials held a chummy meeting with Maduro, who had also been propped up by Russia, Cuba and Iran. No doubt millions of Venezuelans will remember who backed their oppressor and who effected his removal. But the end of Maduro will be a failure if it doesn't also corrode the influence of American adversaries in this hemisphere.</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>Maduro's removal sends an important message to tin-pot dictators in Latin America and the world: Trump follows through. President Joe Biden offered sanctions relief to Venezuela, and Maduro responded to that show of weakness by stealing an election.</p>
                        <p>Trump had telegraphed for months that Maduro could not remain in power, yet Venezuela's illegitimate leader clung on. What are Iranian leaders thinking now as they consider how to respond to widespread anti-government protests? Are the communists in Cuba sleeping well after Secretary of State Marco Rubio put them on notice Saturday?</p>

                    <summary>What Comes Next: Leadership Concerns</summary>
                    <div class="content">
                        <p>The natural question is what comes next. Trump said that "we are going to run the country now" but didn't provide much clarity. Doing so will be critical to winning broader support for more involvement going forward.</p>
                        <p>The ideal outcome would be for María Corina Machado, a Nobel Peace Prize winner and leader of the Venezuelan opposition, to take power. Her Freedom Manifesto — influenced heavily by America's Constitution — is the best outline for Venezuela's future. The details would be tricky, but she would easily win a free and fair election.</p>
                        <p>Trump foolishly claimed during a Saturday afternoon news conference that Machado doesn't have respect within the country, but does he think Maduro's handpicked vice president does? Rubio has spoken with her, and Trump signaled that they expect Maduro's No. 2 to be pliant to U.S. demands, especially relating to opening oil fields for U.S. companies. The president often shoots from his hip in these press conferences and would be wise to reconsider. Empowering a Maduro flunky would be an unforced error with catastrophic consequences.</p>

                    <summary>Warning Against Poor Transition Choices</summary>
                    <div class="content">
                        <p>Some in the Trump administration believe anyone is better than Maduro, and they think that letting her run things will avoid needing to put U.S. troops on the ground (even as Trump expressed openness to that). Perhaps, but anyone from the current regime will be tainted by their association and probably retain links to American adversaries. Any short-term thawing of relations would be a risk. It'd be better to offer high-level figures amnesty, and a life abroad, if they help with the democratic transition.</p>

                    <summary>Risk of Chaos vs. Libya Comparison</summary>
                    <div class="content">
                        <p>Another bad outcome would be if the country falls into total chaos. It's not hard to imagine various armed groups taking control of swaths of the country amid the power vacuum. This would make the refugee crisis caused by Maduro and his predecessor look relatively tame. Although Venezuela is often compared to Libya, that's unfair to the millions of Venezuelans who remember living in a relatively prosperous and democratic society not long ago.</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>Trump offered Maduro several off-ramps. He could have retired and lived a luxury lifestyle in Moscow or Minsk. Instead, he will probably die in prison. It's an all-time miscalculation.</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>There are also legitimate legal questions about the operation, though Maduro was viewed as a criminal by both Trump and Biden, who raised the reward to $25 million for information leading to his arrest. The administration says it did not give anyone in the legislative branch a heads up because of concerns about leaks, and they sold the operation as a law-enforcement action. That's a stretch given the extensive involvement of the military, and it's good for democratic hygiene to scrutinize the decision.</p>

                        <p>With tough decisions coming and many obstacles ahead, it's fair to look forward. Yet it's also fair to celebrate. For years, Maduro was a symbol of the false warmth of Latin American collectivism. Now he should spend the rest of his life in a humane American prison. His downfall is good news.</p>
