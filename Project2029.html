                <li>Democrats are creating "Project 2029" - a ready-made policy agenda for the next Democratic presidential nominee</li>
                <li>The initiative mirrors Project 2025, which Trump's allies created when he was out of office</li>

            <p>As he looks back at the defeat of former Vice President Kamala Harris last fall, the thing that keeps bothering Andrei Cherny, a onetime Democratic speechwriter and state party leader, is that he didn't know what Ms. Harris would have done as president if she had won.</p>

            <p>The way he saw it, President Trump ran on his own ideas, but Ms. Harris only ran against Mr. Trump's. "The oldest truism in politics is you can't beat something with nothing," Mr. Cherny said.</p>

            <p>Now Mr. Cherny, the co-founder of a nearly two-decade-old liberal policy journal, is organizing a group of Democratic thinkers to recreate what Mr. Trump's allies did when he was voted out of office: draft a ready-made agenda for the next Democratic presidential nominee.</p>

            <p><strong>They're calling it Project 2029.</strong></p>

            <p>The title is an unsubtle play on Project 2025, the independently produced right-wing agenda that Mr. Trump spent much of last year's campaign distancing himself from, and much of his first few months back in power executing.</p>

            <h2 style="font-size: 1.5em; margin: 30px 0 20px 0;">A Debate Over Ideas vs. Messaging</h2>

            <p>The undertaking strikes at the heart of a raging debate consuming Democratic lawmakers, strategists and policymakers: whether the root of the party's problems is its ideas or its difficulty in persuading people to embrace them.</p>

            <p>The surprise success of Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist, in the New York mayoral primary only added fuel to that debate. Did he succeed because of the audacity of his ideas â€” "freeze the rent," "free buses" and "free child care" â€” or because of the clarity and simplicity of those phrases?</p>

            <div class="quote">
                "We didn't lack policies. But we lacked a functioning narrative to communicate those policies."
                <div class="quote-attribution">â€” Celinda Lake, Democratic pollster</div>
            </div>

            <p>Ms. Lake complained that Democrats presented voters with "agencies and acronyms and statistics" rather than with a clear story about "what we're going to fight for." An innovative refundable tax rebate, in other words, would not suddenly unlock the Electoral College.</p>

            <p>But others believe the party has been losing ground nationally because its ideas are stale, uninspiring and unresponsive to the demands of today's voters.</p>

            <div class="quote">
                "Liberals underestimate the power of Trump's ideas, and that we need better ideas to take on both Trumpism and the G.O.P. We get wrapped up in his personality. But he puts forward an idea like 'No tax on tips,' and that's an important signifier that he is championing working-class people."

                    <li>â€¢ Jake Sullivan (National Security Adviser under Biden)</li>

            <p>Mr. Cherny, now the president of the journal he helped create, called the assemblage "the Avengers of public policy, or the Justice League, depending on your personal persuasion: the best thinkers from across the spectrum." The group plans to hold public conferences to hammer out their differences on topics including the economy, national security, government reform and education.</p>

            <h2 style="font-size: 1.5em; margin: 30px 0 20px 0;">Skeptics and Internal Divisions</h2>

            <p>Some would-be allies are skeptical that such an ideologically diverse and divergent set of policy minds could craft anything close to a coherent agenda, let alone a politically winning one.</p>

            <div class="quote">
                "Developing policies by checking every coalitional box is how we got in this mess in the first place. There is no way to propose the kind of policies the Democratic Party needs to adopt without pissing off some part of the interest-group Borg."

            </div>

            <p>One of the most visible fissures is between a populist wing that wants to cast corporations and billionaires as villains (see the "Fighting Oligarchy" tour anchored by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont) and advocates of the so-called abundance agenda, named for the book with that title by Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3 style="margin-bottom: 15px; font-size: 1.2em;">Two Competing Visions:</h3>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Abundance Agenda:</strong> Work with corporations, cut through regulation, show that liberalism works</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Populist Wing:</strong> Redistribute power and wealth to the working class away from economic and corporate elites</p>
            </div>

            <p>Nick Gourevitch, a Democratic pollster, said that policies matter, but so does the context in which they are presented to voters. He said it was imperative for Democrats to tell voters that they think the existing system stinks, not just to propose ideas.</p>

            <h2 style="font-size: 1.5em; margin: 30px 0 20px 0;">The Project 2025 Shadow</h2>

            <p>Some party strategists privately expressed concern about the decision to brand Project 2029 after a document that Democrats pilloried in 2024.</p>

            <p>The Biden and Harris campaigns made Project 2025 a central boogeyman in the 2024 race. A New York Times and Siena College poll in September showed that only 15 percent of likely voters said they supported the policies in Project 2025, while 63 percent opposed. An NBC News survey showed Project 2025 was less popular than socialism.</p>

            <p>Michael Tomasky, editor of The New Republic and the Democracy journal, said Project 2025's political toxicity wouldn't mean that Project 2029 "is fated to be unpopular."</p>

            <p>Marc J. Dunkelman, a fellow at the Taubman Center for American Politics and Policy at Brown University who is involved in Project 2029, said the effort's most important goal was to devise ways to connect to voters who have lost faith in the political system.</p>

            <div class="quote">
                "We need to grapple with the fact that people think government isn't working, and they're right. Whether we like it or not, the Democratic Party is the party of government, and government doesn't work. If you want people to vote for us, you have to demonstrate you have a plan to make things work."
