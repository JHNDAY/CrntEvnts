            <strong>Source:</strong> "The 20 Best Things Donald Trump Did in 2025" by Marc A. Thiessen<br>
            <strong>Published:</strong> Washington Post, January 2, 2026<br>
            <strong>Author:</strong> Former George W. Bush speechwriter, American Enterprise Institute fellow, Fox News contributor
        </div>

        <div class="reality-check">
            <strong>CRITICAL NOTE:</strong> This article is written as if from January 2, 2026, describing events of "2025" in past tense. These are speculative predictions/wishes presented as accomplished facts. This is a rhetorical device imagining a hypothetical Trump second term, not reporting on actual events.
        </div>

        <div class="context-box">
            <strong>Contextual Framework:</strong> Marc Thiessen declares Trump has accomplished so much that his usual top-10 list had to expand to 20 items. He concludes: "Love him or hate him, this is an objectively stunning string of accomplishments. I can't think of a president in my lifetime who has accomplished so much in such a short period of time." For conservatives pursuing the nearly century-long project to dismantle the New Deal state, this represents the culmination of their vision.
        </div>

        <h2>The New Deal Dismantlement Project: Key "Accomplishments"</h2>

        <div class="historical-note">
            <strong>Historical Context:</strong> Since FDR's New Deal (1933-1939) established Social Security, labor protections, banking regulations, and the modern administrative state, conservative movements have worked to restore what they view as pre-New Deal American values: minimal government, unrestricted markets, weakened unions, and individual responsibility over collective security.
        </div>

        <h3>Direct Assaults on New Deal Institutions</h3>

        <div class="accomplishment-item">
            <span class="accomplishment-number">#14:</span> <strong>He ended collective bargaining for a million federal workers.</strong>
            <p class="quote">"His executive orders gutting public worker unions mean many federal departments can terminate union contracts and hire and fire based on merit."</p>
            <div class="new-deal-connection">
                <strong>New Deal Connection:</strong> The Wagner Act of 1935 established workers' right to collective bargaining, fundamentally shifting power from employers to workers. Eliminating collective bargaining for federal workers directly reverses this core New Deal achievement, returning to the pre-1935 model where employers held unilateral power over hiring, firing, and working conditions.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="accomplishment-item">
            <span class="accomplishment-number">#13:</span> <strong>He scrapped Biden-era policies intended to force people into electric cars, and unleashed oil and gas production.</strong>
            <p class="quote">"Trump is rolling back Biden's fuel efficiency and tailpipe emissions standards... lifted Biden's pause on natural gas exports... opening up millions of acres in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling and mining... rolling back climate regulations and revoking Biden-era orders that blocked oil and gas drilling in most U.S. coastal waters."</p>
            <div class="new-deal-connection">
                <strong>New Deal Connection:</strong> The New Deal created the regulatory state—federal agencies with authority to regulate business for public welfare. Environmental regulations emerged from this framework. Dismantling these represents the broader conservative goal of eliminating government constraints on business operations, returning to the pre-regulatory era.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="accomplishment-item">
            <span class="accomplishment-number">#11:</span> <strong>He dramatically cut taxes on tips, overtime and Social Security.</strong>
            <p class="quote">"His One Big Beautiful Bill also made his 2017 pro-growth tax cuts permanent."</p>
            <div class="new-deal-connection">
                <strong>New Deal Connection:</strong> Social Security (1935) was funded through payroll taxes based on the principle that those who benefit should contribute. Cutting these taxes undermines the program's funding mechanism. Making tax cuts permanent reduces federal revenue available for social programs, advancing the goal of starving the New Deal state of resources.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="accomplishment-item">
            <span class="accomplishment-number">#8:</span> <strong>He shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development.</strong>
            <p class="quote">"Eliminating USAID as an independent agency has been a conservative goal since the 1990s... Trump has folded its functions into the State Department, eliminated wasteful programs and made sure that U.S. aid decisions support U.S. foreign policy objectives."</p>
            <div class="new-deal-connection">
                <strong>New Deal Connection:</strong> USAID represents the post-WWII expansion of New Deal principles internationally—government programs to provide aid and development assistance. Its elimination reflects the conservative belief that such activities should be left to private organizations or eliminated entirely, not conducted by federal agencies.
            </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Cultural and Educational Warfare</h3>

        <div class="accomplishment-item">
            <span class="accomplishment-number">#16:</span> <strong>He brought many of the nation's elite universities to heel.</strong>
            <p class="quote">"He forced Columbia University to sign a $220 million settlement over diversity, equity and inclusion and over antisemitic civil rights violations on campus, and reached similar settlements with Brown, Cornell, Northwestern, the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Virginia."</p>
            <div class="new-deal-connection">
                <strong>New Deal Connection:</strong> The New Deal expanded federal involvement in education and social programs. Modern DEI initiatives represent this legacy of using institutions to address social inequities. Forcing universities to abandon these programs reverses the principle that institutions should actively work to remedy historical disadvantages.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="accomplishment-item">
            <span class="accomplishment-number">#15:</span> <strong>He took on radical gender ideology and protected women's sports.</strong>
            <p class="quote">"He signed an executive order and issued new regulations to stop U.S. hospitals from engaging in the chemical and surgical mutilation of children and ordered that federal funds be rescinded from any educational institutions that deprive women and girls of fair athletic opportunities."</p>
            <div class="new-deal-connection">
                <strong>New Deal Connection:</strong> Using federal funding to enforce social policy echoes New Deal methods—but in reverse. Where New Deal used federal dollars to advance social protections, this uses withdrawal of federal funds to enforce conservative cultural values, demonstrating how New Deal tools can be weaponized against New Deal principles.
            </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Border and Immigration</h3>

        <div class="accomplishment-item">
            <span class="accomplishment-number">#18:</span> <strong>He drove illegal migration to a virtual halt.</strong>
            <p class="quote">"Biden claimed he needed legislation from Congress to secure the border; Trump shut down the border in weeks with no new congressional authority. Encounters at the border are at record lows, apprehensions are 95 percent lower than the daily average under Joe Biden, and no illegal migrants have been released into the United States for seven months."</p>
            <div class="new-deal-connection">
                <strong>New Deal Connection:</strong> While not directly New Deal policy, the broader progressive tradition of viewing immigration through a humanitarian lens emerged from New Deal-era expansion of social concern. Thiessen's celebration of harsh enforcement represents the pre-New Deal approach of viewing immigration primarily as a law enforcement matter.
            </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Military and National Security State</h3>

        <div class="accomplishment-item">
            <span class="accomplishment-number">#9:</span> <strong>He added $156 billion to the defense budget.</strong>
            <p class="quote">"As part of his One Big Beautiful Bill, Trump made a down payment on the second Trump defense buildup, including funding for his 'Golden Dome' defense shield to protect America from ballistic missile attacks, which will fulfill the vision Ronald Reagan put forward with his Strategic Defense Initiative."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="accomplishment-item">
            <span class="accomplishment-number">#12:</span> <strong>He made our nation's capital safer by sending in the National Guard.</strong>
            <p class="quote">"After Trump took federal control of the D.C. police and deployed the Guard, crime in the District dropped by double-digits in virtually every category."</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Foreign Policy "Triumphs"</h3>

        <div class="accomplishment-item">
            <span class="accomplishment-number">#1:</span> <strong>He obliterated the Iranian nuclear program.</strong>
            <p class="quote">"Four presidents promised to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, but only Trump took decisive action to halt it. Launching Operation Midnight Hammer is possibly the most important and courageous foreign policy decision any president has made in the past half-century."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="accomplishment-item">
            <span class="accomplishment-number">#4:</span> <strong>He forged one of the greatest peacemaking records in U.S. history.</strong>
            <p class="quote">"He has made progress toward lasting peace in conflicts between India and Pakistan, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda, Cambodia and Thailand, and Armenia and Azerbaijan. He also brought the war between Israel and Iran to an end after 12 days and brokered a deal to end the Israel-Hamas war that secured the release of all remaining hostages... This is an unprecedented record worthy of a Nobel Peace Prize."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="accomplishment-item">
            <span class="accomplishment-number">#2:</span> <strong>He got NATO allies to meet and raise their defense spending promises.</strong>
            <p class="quote">"Today, all allies are on track to spend 2 percent of GDP on defense this year, and at a triumphant NATO summit in the Netherlands, Trump got allies to agree to raise their spending to 5 percent by 2035 — more than double their previous commitment."</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Additional Items</h3>

        <div class="accomplishment-item">
            <span class="accomplishment-number">#19:</span> <strong>He created "Trump Accounts" to give every American child a trust fund.</strong>
            <p class="quote">"The federal government will put $1,000 into a tax-advantaged investment account for every American child born between Jan. 1, 2025, and Dec. 31, 2028... The Treasury Department estimates the accounts could grow to between $3,000 and $13,800 in 18 years."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="accomplishment-item">
            <span class="accomplishment-number">#17:</span> <strong>He used tariff threats to strike new trade deals.</strong>
            <p class="quote">"Trump struck a deal that includes a 15 percent baseline tariff on most European exports to the U.S., while most U.S. exports to the E.U. will be duty-free... He also used tariffs as leverage to reach deals with Britain, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines and Cambodia."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="accomplishment-item">
            <span class="accomplishment-number">#20:</span> <strong>He delivered justice for the Abbey Gate bombing.</strong>
            <p class="quote">"It took Trump less than six weeks to capture what he described as a 'top terrorist' responsible for the attack" that killed 13 U.S. service members.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Broader Vision: Completing the Counter-Revolution</h2>

        <p>Thiessen's concluding assessment reveals the scope of conservative ambition:</p>

        <p class="quote">"Love him or hate him, this is an objectively stunning string of accomplishments. I can't think of a president in my lifetime who has accomplished so much in such a short period of time. And whatever one thinks of Trump's record, he needs to be judged against the alternative. Kamala Harris was the most radical Democratic nominee in history, and the damage she would have done as president would have been irreparable. Instead, Trump took the oath of office with a popular vote mandate to do everything on this list — and more."</p>

        <p>The phrase "and more" is telling—these 20 items represent not completion but acceleration of the conservative project. For nearly a century, from the Liberty League's opposition in the 1930s through Reagan's revolution and beyond, conservatives have pursued the goal of restoring pre-New Deal America: minimal government, unrestricted markets, weakened unions, reduced social programs, and individual responsibility over collective security.</p>

        <div class="historical-note">
            <strong>Historical Irony:</strong> What Thiessen celebrates as restoration of "authentic" American values represents a return to the conditions that produced the Great Depression—conditions so catastrophic they generated overwhelming democratic support for the New Deal reforms these policies now systematically dismantle. The question remains whether Americans who never experienced pre-New Deal insecurity understand what they're being returned to.
        </div>

        <h2>The 90-Year Project Nears Completion</h2>

        <p>From this perspective, Trump's imagined second term represents not aberration but culmination. Through decades of institution-building—think tanks like the American Enterprise Institute (where Thiessen is a fellow), the Federalist Society's judicial project, talk radio, Fox News, and successive Republican administrations—conservatives built the infrastructure to fundamentally reshape American governance.</p>

        <p>The targets are systematic:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Labor power</strong> (ending collective bargaining)</li>
            <li><strong>Regulatory authority</strong> (environmental, safety, consumer protections)</li>
            <li><strong>Social program funding</strong> (tax cuts reducing revenue)</li>
            <li><strong>Administrative expertise</strong> (eliminating independent agencies)</li>
            <li><strong>Educational institutions</strong> (forcing abandonment of equity programs)</li>
            <li><strong>International cooperation</strong> (America First unilateralism)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Each represents a pillar of the post-New Deal order. Their systematic dismantlement—celebrated by Thiessen as "stunning accomplishments"—marks the potential reversal of 90 years of governance philosophy.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion: Mission Accomplished?</h2>

        <p>Thiessen's article functions as both celebration and roadmap. Written in the past tense from an imagined future, it reveals what conservatives hope Trump will accomplish: the completion of their nearly century-long project to restore pre-New Deal America.</p>

        <p>The fundamental question remains: Are these truly "real American values" being restored, or are we dismantling hard-won protections forged from economic catastrophe? Thiessen has clearly answered—and his celebration of Trump's "objectively stunning string of accomplishments" reveals the conservative movement's ultimate goal. After 90+ years, they see themselves finally winning.</p>

        <div class="footnote">
            <strong>Analysis Note:</strong> This HTML summary contextualizes Thiessen's opinion piece within the century-long conservative project to roll back New Deal reforms. His celebration of these speculative "accomplishments" reveals the systematic nature of the effort to restore pre-1933 governance principles—minimal government, unrestricted markets, weakened labor power, and reduced social programs. Whether this represents progress or regression depends entirely on one's view of the New Deal's legacy.
