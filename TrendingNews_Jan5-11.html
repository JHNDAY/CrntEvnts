Combined with One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) cuts, 10-15 million could lose coverage. Johns Hopkins estimates up to 15 million more uninsured by 2034 from OBBBA alone. OBBBA includes over $1 trillion in healthcare cuts through 2034 - "biggest cut to our social safety net in history." New sign-ups dropped considerably in Pennsylvania and California during enrollment period; 21 state-based exchanges saw 18% decrease in new customers to 210,500.</div>

Restrictions on lawfully present noncitizens - refugees, asylees, TPS recipients no longer eligible for ACA subsidies. DACA recipients ineligible for ACA Marketplace coverage. New enrollees must prove eligibility before receiving subsidies - no more 90-day grace period. Fiscal incentives for Medicaid expansion end, leaving 10 non-expansion states with less motivation. Urban Institute projects uninsured rates to jump 65% in Mississippi, 50% in South Carolina.</div>

                        <div class="subtopic-description">Century Foundation survey: 250 million Americans will face health insurance premium increases in 2026 far exceeding inflation, wage growth, Social Security adjustments. Nearly 3 in 10 Americans (29%) report delaying or going without medical care in past year. One in four people (24%) delayed or skipped buying doctor-prescribed medication due to finances. Employer-based health costs projected to rise as much as 7% for 2026 plans. Medicaid represents ~20% of hospital revenue nationwide. Johns Hopkins warning: "If hospitals see increase in uninsured people who can't pay bills, they're going to increase rates for other payers."</div>
