        <h1 class="title">The American Fitna</h1>
        
        <div class="prelude">
            In the mid-11th century, the political polity of the multi-cultural flourishing of Córdoba, "The Jewel of the World," was fractured by religious zealotry and uncompromising ideology. The Andalusian Fitna—a period of civil strife and fragmentation—saw the dissolution of the Caliphate of Córdoba into competing taifa kingdoms, each claiming legitimacy while destroying the very foundations that had made al-Andalus a beacon of learning, tolerance, and prosperity. What followed was not renewal, but the systematic dismantling of institutions that had fostered centuries of intercultural dialogue and intellectual achievement. Today, we witness echoes of this historical tragedy as democratic institutions face unprecedented assault from within.

                    Executive Order 14160 attempted to unilaterally reinterpret the 14th Amendment, seeking to deny citizenship to children born to undocumented parents or those on temporary visas. This frontal attack on constitutional law represents a foundational challenge to American identity itself.
