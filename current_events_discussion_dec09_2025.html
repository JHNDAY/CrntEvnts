                    <h4>Messy but Moving Forward</h4>
                    When Burns does documentaries, he tells a "truthful story of how messy our... the evolution of our country has been." But there's no doubt Burns has great respect and affection for the United States.

                    It was hard to feel that way in the 1920s with the KKK everywhere, the American Nightmare. Various periods have been difficult (Know-Nothings, etc.), "but we have managed to move forward, and I think we'll move forward past the Trump years."

                    <h4>George's Key Point</h4>
                    "Many of the things that made us great are diversity. Immigrants who've made such big contributions... our higher educational system, et cetera, are all under attack by these Luddites."
