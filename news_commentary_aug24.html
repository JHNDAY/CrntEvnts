        <div class="section">
            <h2>Washington D.C. Federal Incursion</h2>
            <p>After the incursion was announced, data emerged which indicated that the violent crime rate in the District had hit a 30-year low and that several cities including Houston, Memphis, Monroe LA (in Mike Johnson's CD) and Nashville had higher violent crime rates. In response, the DOJ is launching an investigation to determine if this favorable comparative data, which Trump referred to as <span class="highlight">"fake crime numbers"</span>, had been manipulated.</p>
            
            <p>Carrying his 5P approach a step further, Trump "participated" in a police patrol, declared "Washington D.C. is SAFE AGAIN" and fabricated a story about a child telling him that their family had just dined out four days in a row after not having been able to do so for four years. Quite to the contrary, restaurant traffic in DC has declined and <span class="highlight">retail traffic is down 80%</span> since the incursion.</p>
            
            <p>Trump's acolytes supported the president's position as newly installed U.S. Attorney for D.C. Jeanine Pirro told prosecutors in her office to seek the highest possible charges for any federal arrests and Pete Hegseth authorized National Guard troops in the District to be armed. Not to be outdone, Kristi Noem is seeking to spend <span class="highlight">$2.4 MM for gold-detailing</span> on DHS vehicles in the District and adding "Defend the Homeland" wraps. Joining in on her Adventures in Bad Taste, Trump will be asking Congress for <span class="highlight">$2 B to "beautify"</span> the area within three miles of the White House and the Capitol and keep it "clean". Apparently the areas with the genuine high crime rates and minority populations do not make for good television.</p>
            
            <div class="quote">

            <p>After the L.A. and D.C. incursions, it has come to light that the Department of Defense is planning an operation in Chicago, another Blue city with a black mayor. Trump chimed in "Chicago's a mess. You have an incompetent mayor".</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Ukraine Peace Talks</h2>
            <p>Looking back at Trump's Ukraine peace blitz, the title of Shakespeare's play <em>Much Ado About Nothing</em> comes to mind. In spite of the high expectations set for last week's Alaska and White House meetings, absolutely nothing was accomplished. This was made abundantly clear by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on MTP yesterday when he said that an <span class="highlight">"agenda is not ready at all"</span> for a future Putin/Zelensky meeting and questioned Zelensky's legitimacy.</p>
            
            <p>It is entirely possible now that Trump will turn his attention elsewhere and reduce the U.S. support for Ukraine. In the wake of the meetings, Trump said "I've ended six wars, and I thought that maybe this would be the easiest one, and...It's a tough one". He added, referring to himself, "Anyone can make war, but only the most courageous can make peace".</p>
            
            <p><strong>Here's what some pundits had to say:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>With regard to his ending six wars, Masha Gessen counted that he actually cited stopping seven, and then commented <em>"That's actually seven. But also none"</em>. Later on, Trump said that he actually had ended ten wars if "you think about pre-wars".</li>
                <li>Christopher Bates wrote <em>"Trump is some combination of dishonest and delusional"</em>.</li>
                <li>Bret Stephens said <em>"By putting the interests of what Trump calls 'peace' ahead of the interests of freedom, we are all but guaranteed that Ukraine will lose both"</em>.</li>
                <li>Max Bergmann of the Center for Strategic and International Studies opined <em>"He (Trump) looks like someone trying to salvage his credibility but is unwilling to get tough with Putin and back Ukraine"</em>.</li>
                <li>With regard to assertions that progress had been made toward an agreement which could soon be reached, Celeste Wallander who served in the Biden DOD said <em>"Russia and Ukraine aren't just miles apart, they are hundreds of miles apart"</em>.</li>
                <li>Jennifer Rubin commented <em>"Ukraine has found out the hard way that U.S. security guarantees are worthless...and when offered under this president (are) more likely a recipe for extortion"</em>.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Retribution</h2>
            <p>During the campaign, Trump constantly addressed crowds telling them "I am your retribution", but what he really cared about was his own retribution. Sometimes this retribution overlaps with the dismantling of government, accomplishing two of Trump's top priorities in a single swoop.</p>
            
            <p>The most striking retributive activity this week was the early morning FBI raid of John Bolton's home on Friday, ostensibly to find classified documents he had illegally retained. Given what happened after Trump's first term, these grounds are an exercise in chutzpah. Presumably the search started in Bolton's bathrooms.</p>
            
            <div class="quote">
                I think it is a retribution presidency.
                <div class="quote-author">â€” John Bolton</div>
            </div>
            
            <p>In addition to weaponizing the FBI headed by Kash Patel, the administration has been utilizing FHFA commissioner Bill Pulte to conjure charges of mortgage fraud against Adam Schiff, Letitia James and Lisa Cook, the latter being the first black female Federal Reserve governor and a Biden appointee. AG Pam Bondi is more than happy to follow through. Once again irony reigns supreme as Letitia James is the NY AG who obtained a fraud judgment against Trump and his companies in connection with real estate loans.</p>
            
            <p><strong>In other retributive/dismantling activity this week:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tulsi Gabbard rescinded the security clearances of 37 current and former national security officials for having engaged in the "politicalization or weaponization of intelligence" and failing to "adhere to professional analytic tradecraft standards".</li>
                <li>In addition, Gabbard announced plans to reduce the ODNI staffing by 50%, availing more opportunities for retributive dismissals.</li>
                <li>U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Allvin is resigning halfway through his 4-year term because Pete Hegseth "wanted to go in another direction".</li>
                <li>Pete Hegseth fired DIA head Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse, presumably because the agency stepped back Trump's claims that our bombings "obliterated" the Iranian nuclear facilities.</li>
                <li>Shahed Ghoreishi, top press officer for communications about Israel and Gaza, was fired by the State Department for drafting a statement that the U.S. does not support the forced relocation of Gazans.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="quote">
                The current DOJ's mission is not to be an independent agency...(but) to serve one Donald J. Trump and intimidate anyone who crosses him or threatens his agenda.

            <h2>Immigration</h2>
            <p>After the administration said that Kilmar Abrego Garcia (KAG) should "never go free", he was released from federal custody in TN on Friday. Within minutes of his release, DHS informed his attorneys that unless he accepts a guilty plea on human smuggling charges by Monday, in which case he would be deported to Costa Rica, he would be deported to Uganda and KAG was ordered to report to DHS in Baltimore today. Upon his release, Kristi Noem referred to him as <span class="highlight">"a MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, serial domestic abuser, and child predator"</span> as she followed the Roy Cohn playbook's "never admit you're wrong...You have to be willing to do anything to anyone" sections.</p>
            
            <p><strong>In other immigration news:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>According to Pew, the number of unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. grew to 14 million in 2023, a considerably higher number than previously estimated. It also reported that during the first 6-7 months of the Trump administration the number of immigrants living in the country declined from 53.3 MM to 51.9 MM.</li>
                <li>A federal judge ordered that no more immigration detainees be sent to Alligator Alcatraz and that much of the facility be dismantled in response to environmental concerns.</li>
                <li>Responding to an impulsive suggestion from Trump, Kristi Noem announced earlier in the week that the southern border wall would be painted black. Apparently ICE Barbie really enjoys cosplaying, living in the Coast Guard Commandant's house and flying in its Gulfstream jets.</li>
                <li>A federal judge denied the administration's request to hold unaccompanied children for more than the stipulated 72 hours before they have to be turned over to HHS where presumably they would not have to worry about being vaccinated.</li>

            <h2>Elections</h2>
            <p>In TX, the state legislature passed the congressional gerrymander bill which Trump requested to gain 3-5 House seats and Governor Abbott said "One Big Beautiful Map has passed the Senate, and is on the way to my desk, where it will quickly be signed into law". A Democratic state representative commented that it only took <span class="highlight">445k white residents</span> to secure a congressional seat under the new map compared to <span class="highlight">1.4 MM Latinos and 2.0 MM blacks</span>.</p>
            
            <p>Under Governor Newsom's leadership, CA responded in kind and passed a redistricting bill, contingent upon TX following through, which would defer the authority of its independent election commission until after the 2030 census. This will require a special election in November to suspend the state's current congressional map. Commenting on this CA approach, Democratic strategist Jamaal Simmons said <em>"Democrats are over being the 'nice guy' party"</em>. It should be noted that former governor Schwarzenegger opposes this ballot measure and no credible polling data on public support is yet available.</p>
            
            <p>Trump is calling for gerrymanders without justification in all states where Republicans have full control as he is deploying his favored "might makes right" approach. Given that Republicans hold the trifecta in 23 states versus 15 for the Democrats, they have a considerable advantage in this regard. Turning Republican gerrymandering on its head, Speaker Mike Johnson brazenly said <em>"Democrats across the nation have played politics with redistricting for decades"</em>.</p>
            
            <div class="stats">
                <strong>2012 Election Results:</strong><br>
                Democrats won presidency by 3.9% margin â€¢ Controlled Senate â€¢ Won national House vote by 1.4%<br>
                <strong>Yet Republicans achieved 234-201 advantage in House seats</strong>
            </div>
            
            <p>But gerrymanders alone are not enough to satiate our president's hunger for absolute political control. Goaded on by Putin in Alaska, he is now launching a campaign to stop all mail-in voting (there were about 40 MM of them in 2024, 26% of the total vote) and said that by doing so in conjunction with maximum gerrymandering <span class="highlight">"we will pick up 100 more seats, and the CROOKED games of politics is over"</span>.</p>
