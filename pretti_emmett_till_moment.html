            <h4>1. The Visual Evidence That Contradicts Official Narrative</h4>
            <p><strong>Emmett Till:</strong> His mother, Mamie Till-Mobley, insisted on an open casket so "the world could see what they did to my baby." Jet magazine's photos shocked the nation.</p>
            <p><strong>Alex Pretti:</strong> Multiple verified videos from at least four angles show him filming with his phone, not brandishing a gun. Video shows an agent removing the gun from his waistband one second before shots were fired.</p>

            <h4>2. The Immediate Character Assassination by Authorities</h4>
            <p><strong>Till Case:</strong> Defense portrayed Emmett as a sexual predator who deserved what happened. The "protective" narrative of Southern white womanhood.</p>
            <p><strong>Pretti Case:</strong> Within hours, federal officials labeled him an "assassin" who wanted to "massacre law enforcement" and commit "domestic terrorism." Border Patrol Commander Bovino couldn't answer when asked to specify when Pretti pulled his gun.</p>

            <p><strong>Pretti's Reality:</strong> ICU nurse caring for veterans. Colleagues described him as "kindhearted," someone whose "default look was a smile." Member of AFGE unions (Local 704 and 3669). No criminal record. Loved his Catahoula Leopard dog Joule. Competitive cyclist and outdoorsman.</p>
            <p><strong>Federal Characterization:</strong> Armed threat, assassin, domestic terrorist who showed up to "massacre" officers.</p>

Strider claimed the body pulled from the river wasn't Till's, and the all-white jury acquitted in 67 minutes. The system protected the murderers. Similarly, federal officials are obstructing local investigation while calling Pretti an "assassin" and "domestic terrorist" before any investigation concluded.

Rosa Parks said the case was on her mind when she refused to give up her seat. Similarly, Pretti's killing is generating immediate political consequences — including from Republicans — suggesting this may be crossing partisan lines in ways that could force change.

            <strong>The Rosa Parks Principle:</strong> Till's murder didn't immediately change laws, but it changed what was politically possible. Republicans breaking ranks matters because social change often requires establishment figures to abandon the status quo. When Republican senators like Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski call for investigation, when a Republican gubernatorial candidate withdraws citing the killing, it signals the political cost of defending these actions may be becoming unsustainable.

            <h4>The Family's Plea: "Get the Truth Out"</h4>
            <p>Parents Michael and Susan Pretti: "The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting. Alex is clearly not holding a gun when attacked by Trump's murdering and cowardly ICE thugs. He has his phone in his right hand and his empty left hand is raised above his head while trying to protect the woman ICE just pushed down all while being pepper sprayed. <strong>Please get the truth out about our son. He was a good man.</strong>"</p>
            <p>Sister Micayla Pretti: "All Alex ever wanted was to help someone — anyone. Even in his very last moments on this earth, he was simply trying to do just that."</p>

            <strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Emmett Till's mother, Mamie Till-Mobley, turned her grief into activism. The Pretti family is doing the same — asking people to "get the truth out." When families refuse to be silent and demand accountability, and when that demand resonates across partisan lines (note the Republican governors and senators calling for investigation), it suggests the political ground is shifting.

            <strong>The Till Foundation:</strong> Emmett Till's murder in August 1955 didn't immediately spark the Civil Rights Movement — the movement was already building. But his death became the symbol that made ongoing injustice undeniable. Three months later, Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat. The Montgomery Bus Boycott began. Till's murder gave people a focal point around which to organize existing anger into sustained action.

            <h4>The Rosa Parks Principle</h4>
            <p><strong>The Till Context:</strong> Rosa Parks wasn't the first person arrested for refusing to give up her seat. But she was the right person, at the right time, with the right organizing infrastructure behind her. Emmett Till's murder came just months before Parks' arrest — the outrage was building, the organizing networks were in place, and Till's death had already shown the world the brutality of the system.</p>
            <p><strong>The Pretti Context:</strong> Similarly, Pretti's killing is the third shooting in three weeks. Renée Good was killed January 7. The infrastructure of protest and documentation was already in place. Thousands had already marched in subzero temperatures. The question is whether this death becomes the focal point that transforms ongoing resistance into sustained movement.</p>
            <p class="context-note">When Rosa Parks said Till's murder was on her mind when she refused to move, she revealed how a single death can crystallize years of accumulated anger into a moment of choice. Is Pretti that moment for resistance to federal overreach?</p>

            <h4>What Former Vice President Kamala Harris Said</h4>
            <p>"Alex Jeffrey Pretti was an ICU nurse at a VA hospital. His life, through his profession, was dedicated to serving his community and our country. As so many have now seen on video, his final act before he was killed by federal agents was doing everything in his power to protect his community."</p>
            <p>Harris, who lost the 2024 presidential election to Trump, added that she was "enraged and heartbroken" for Pretti, his family, Minneapolis, and America.</p>

            <h4>What Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison Said</h4>
            <p>"I share the intense grief and anger of so many that another Minnesotan — Alex Pretti, 37 years old, an ICU nurse who served veterans — was fatally shot during the Trump Administration's Operation Metro Surge."</p>
            <p>Ellison's office successfully won an emergency court order preventing DHS from destroying evidence related to the shooting. He has described the deployment of federal agents as a "federal invasion" and characterized DHS actions as feeling "like a cover-up."</p>

            <strong>Why Catalyzing Moments Work:</strong> Emmett Till's murder worked as a catalyst because it combined clear injustice, visual evidence (the photos), vocal family advocacy (his mother's courage), and existing organizing infrastructure. Pretti's case has all these elements: clear video evidence contradicting official lies, a family demanding truth, bipartisan outrage, and existing protest networks. The question isn't whether the ingredients are there — it's whether they'll combine into sustained action that forces systemic change.

        <p>The comparison to Emmett Till isn't about equating the circumstances — it's about asking whether a single death, caught on camera, with evidence contradicting the official narrative, might crystallize existing resistance into a movement for change.</p>
