                        <div class="subtopic-description">Just Security's litigation tracker (updated daily through December 19) shows 186 total plaintiff wins against Trump administration actions: 50 government actions blocked, 103 temporarily blocked, 28 blocked pending appeal, 5 cases closed in favor of plaintiff. This compares to 113 total government wins, with 214 cases still awaiting court rulings. December 19: Supreme Court dealt Trump administration its "first real loss" since April, rejecting request to block 4th Circuit ruling in immigration judges case (law professor Stephen Vladeck). December 12: 7th Circuit became first federal appeals court to reject Trump's mandatory detention argument. November 21: District Court permanently blocked Trump's executive order dismantling Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS)—ruling actions were "arbitrary and capricious and contrary to federal law."</div>

After government argued order was "ambiguous," McConnell laid out in greater detail the funds government must restore, stopping short of contempt but warning administration. December 9: Judge Jamal Whitehead (Washington) rejected government request to pause discovery in refugee lawsuit, ordering it to proceed despite administration's claim it "would experience hardship" if forced to turn over documents. Brennan Center analysis noted judges have "range of tools for enforcing orders" including civil contempt (fines accruing daily until compliance) and criminal contempt.</div>

Government Accountability Project is suing Trump over unconstitutional rollback of federal worker protections with partner organizations. 200 DOJ employees who left wrote open letter December saying administration is making "coordinated effort" to undermine career staff, transferring career leaders "to work on menial activities" unrelated to experience. Whistleblower Aid's Andrew Bakaj: "This is not accountability, this is retaliation masquerading as reform." The Conversation reported whistleblower groups are "organising... to shore up workers' rights, challenge threats in the courts, and inform the public."</div>

Multiple state AGs filed lawsuits challenging birthright citizenship order, refugee suspension, and other executive actions. State-level litigation has been critical component of institutional pushback, with states using their legal standing to challenge federal overreach where individual plaintiffs might lack resources.</div>

                        <div class="subtopic-description">December 15: Federal appeals court judges scrutinized Trump's national security basis for collective bargaining rollback during oral arguments. Judge Neomi Rao (Trump appointee) noted statute "provides certain criteria" for presidential determinations. Judge Bradley Garcia (Biden appointee) said court "ought not to second-guess" but expressed concern if record suggests "president didn't make those determinations." December 19: IMLS reinstated all agency grants to libraries after court ruling. December 12: Indiana rejected redistricting plan seen as favoring Trump's priorities. Federal judges around the country continued to issue restraining orders throughout December despite administration's claims of judicial overreach.</div>

                        <div class="subtopic-description">Despite mass firings, career officials who remained continued professional work and resisted political pressure. Career prosecutors at DOJ recommended against indicting James Comey (ABC News, September), though political appointees proceeded anyway. Erik Siebert, predecessor to current prosecutor, refused to indict Comey "due to lack of evidence"—a decision looking increasingly correct as case proceeds. Former DOJ employees noted political appointees conducting litigation directly are being "chide[d]" by judges "for their shortcomings." The resilience comes from career officials' commitment to professional standards, legal procedures, and institutional norms even under extreme pressure to abandon them.</div>
