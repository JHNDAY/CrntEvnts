On December 18 alone, the US killed 5 people in strikes on two boats, marking the third attack that week. Operation Southern Spear, announced November 13, uses a fleet with robotics and autonomous systems. The administration has provided only grainy footage as evidence boats were carrying drugs, while describing victims as "narco-terrorists." December 16 saw three strikes killing 8 people in the Eastern Pacific. Legal experts argue these killings likely violate US and international law and amount to extrajudicial executions.</div>

Two men who survived the initial strike were killed in a subsequent "double tap" strike. Admiral Frank "Mitch" Bradley told lawmakers he understood his mission was to kill all 11 men on the boat. Trump initially said he "wouldn't have wanted" a second strike but later reversed to support "knocking out the boats." Hegseth initially claimed "I watched it live" but later acknowledged he "didn't stick around" when decisions about survivors were made.</div>

                        <div class="subtopic-description">On December 16, White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles revealed the true motive in Vanity Fair: "He [Trump] wants to keep on blowing boats up until Maduro cries uncle." This contradicted the official narrative of stopping drugs. The administration's story about where the first boat was headed changed multiple times: initially "headed to Trinidad," then Trump said "coming to the United States," finally revealed to be headed for Suriname (a transit country for drugs to Europe, not the US). Senator Chris Van Hollen stated the tanker seizure shows "their whole cover story—that this is about interdicting drugs—is a big lie. This is really about regime change—by force."</div>

                        <div class="subtopic-description">On December 10, Trump announced the US seized the "Skipper," an oil tanker off Venezuela's coast carrying Venezuelan crude—the "largest one ever seized." The vessel was seized in international waters under a federal warrant for alleged links to Iran-backed terror groups. This marked an incredibly unusual use of US forces to take control of a merchant ship. Naval historian Vincent P. O'Hara called it "very unusual" and "provocative," noting it will "deter other ships from the Venezuela coastline" and that "if you have no maritime traffic or access to that, then you have no economy." The action came a day after US fighter jets flew over the Gulf of Venezuela.</div>

                        <div class="subtopic-description">On December 19, the House rejected resolutions challenging Trump's military actions against alleged drug-trafficking boats and targeting Venezuela. Defense Secretary Hegseth told lawmakers at a December 17 classified briefing he was still weighing whether to release unedited videos of strikes. The annual defense policy bill Trump signed December 19 includes a provision withholding a quarter of Hegseth's travel budget until unedited videos are released to Armed Services Committees. As of November 6, the Republican-controlled Senate twice rejected resolutions limiting Trump's authority for military action against Venezuela. The Colombian and Venezuelan governments accused the US of extrajudicial murder.</div>

                        <div class="subtopic-description">Trump refused to rule out a ground invasion of Venezuela and declared its airspace "closed in its entirety." The US deployed the world's largest aircraft carrier, USS Gerald R. Ford, and an armada of ships to Venezuelan waters—the largest military presence in the region in decades. Trump joked in October that "there are no fishing boats" near Venezuela due to US attacks. On December 18, Trump ordered a "total and complete blockade" of sanctioned oil tankers to/from Venezuela. Venezuelan President Maduro responded: "Eight warships, with 1,200 missiles and a nuclear submarine, are targeting Venezuela. If Venezuela is attacked, we will declare ourselves in armed struggle." CNN reported the administration is working on contingency plans for post-Maduro Venezuela, with critics drawing comparisons to failed Iraq planning.</div>

Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US, warned: "Wage growth is easing into a sustained affordability crisis." Bank of America deposit data showed top earners got 4% raises while most workers saw less. The US economy lost jobs in three of the past six months, with 2025 on pace for the worst job growth since the pandemic. Workers are staying in jobs longer, with voluntary quit rates at a five-year low in October, reducing employer incentive to give raises.</div>

BLS didn't collect October data and only gathered half of November due to the shutdown (Oct 1-Nov 12). The data sample from mid-to-late November may have captured more Black Friday sales, making prices look artificially low. Core goods inflation fell to 1.4% from 1.5%, contrary to expectations of upward pressure from tariffs. Beef prices surged 21% annually, coffee up 19%, bananas up 7%. Fed Chair Powell noted "tariff-induced inflation will take a long time to become clear."</div>

A staggering 71% say their income just matches or falls short of monthly expenses. In the poll, 45% said high prices are their biggest economic worry, while only 10% worried about job security. Fed Governor Christopher Waller acknowledged wealthy families spend freely but low/middle-income families face a genuine "affordability problem." University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index showed a "broadly somber" tenor in December despite a small rise, with consumers continuing to "cite the burden of high prices."</div>

In New York City, 40% of families can't afford weekly food costs. Grocery prices were 18% higher in September than January 2022. Nearly half of Americans say it's harder to afford groceries than a year ago (Axios/Harris Poll). Shoppers like Anne Marie Hadley told CBS: "The cost of beef is astronomical. I will mainly get what's on sale." Americans paid 2.7% more for groceries in September than a year earlier—but bills have climbed 49% since 2020. NielsenIQ showed canned cranberry sauce jumped from $2.02 (Nov 2024) to $2.52 (Oct 2025) due to aluminum tariffs.</div>

Redfin reported both sellers and buyers pulling back, with sales prices rising nonetheless. More than 75% of homes across the country are unaffordable for typical households (Bankrate). Shelter inflation hit a four-year low and median rent fell for four straight months, but Fed Chair Powell noted the housing problem is chronic undersupply that rate cuts can't fix.

On December 9, the White House claimed "substantial progress reversing inflation," noting eggs, butter, ice cream, fresh fruit dropped in price. However, CBS fact-check showed beef steaks surged 17% from a year ago. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene told Sean Spicer that Trump's "gaslighting the people and trying to tell them that prices have come down is not helping." Ben Shapiro noted: "When President Trump says things are becoming more affordable, people don't believe that because they aren't really more affordable."</div>

On December 11, the Senate voted on ACA measures but neither Democrats' three-year extension nor Republicans' health savings account alternative advanced. House Democrats secured enough support December 17 to force a January vote on a three-year extension, but it faces significant Senate hurdles. Without extension, average premiums will increase 75% for 2026. Low/middle-income households previously qualifying for tax credits will see ACA premiums rise from an average of $888 in 2025 to $1,904 in 2026 (KFF analysis). Four out of five consumers found 2025 plans for $10 or less monthly—that ends January 1.</div>

New sign-ups dropped considerably in Pennsylvania and California through November 22. Overall, 21 state-based exchanges saw an 18% decrease in new customers to 210,500. The federal exchange (healthcare.gov) had a slight uptick to 739,000 through November 29. CBO estimates without enhanced subsidies, 14+ million more people will be uninsured by 2034. Combined with the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" (OBBBA) cuts, 10-15 million people could lose coverage. Johns Hopkins estimates up to 15 million more uninsured by 2034 from OBBBA alone. Jeremy Tolbert of Kansas saw premiums set to rise 18% to $2,600/month for 2026.</div>

California allocated $190 million to replace enhanced subsidies for lowest-income enrollees—far short of the $2.5 billion in federal enhanced subsidies Californians received in 2025 (Covered California). Massachusetts residents below 400% of poverty level qualify for longstanding state subsidies providing additional aid, though most will still see increases. AMA and 90+ physician organizations sent letters in September urging Congress to extend subsidies, warning the expiration will worsen patient access and force difficult care tradeoffs.</div>

Johns Hopkins' Liz Fowler warned: "Just because you have insurance through your employer doesn't mean you won't be impacted.

It's not possible for 10-15 million people to lose health insurance and not have effects on the rest of the system." Employer-based health costs are projected to rise as much as 7% for 2026 plans (Mercer). Americans now pay an average of $265 per month in utility costs, up 12% since last year.</div>

Ben Shapiro opened by attacking Tucker Carlson as a "charlatan" for interviewing white nationalist Nick Fuentes, saying "the conservative movement is in danger from charlatans who claim to speak in principle, but actually traffic in conspiracism and dishonesty." Carlson fired back: "There's a lot of blood at stake here, as the question becomes, who gets to run it after, who gets the machinery when the President exits the scene. There are a lot of people in Washington, maybe even in this room, who aren't quite sure what they want, but they know they don't want—JD Vance." Erika Kirk, Charlie's widow and Turning Point's new leader, warned: "Since the assassination, we've seen fractures, we've seen bridges being burned that shouldn't be burnt."</div>

                        <div class="subtopic-description">The Supreme Court heard oral arguments December 8 on Trump's firing of FTC Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter. Justices seemed open to overruling the 90-year Humphrey's Executor precedent that prevents presidents from removing members of independent agencies at will. Trump appointed Slaughter in 2018 to fill a Democratic seat but fired her in March 2025 without citing "inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance"—the only legal grounds for removal. In September, justices voted 6-3 along ideological lines to allow her firing to stand pending the case. The administration argues Humphrey's Executor was flawed due to misunderstanding of FTC's functions. A win for Trump would give him and future presidents far greater control over FTC, FCC, NLRB, and other independent agencies.</div>

The justices let stand a ruling raising questions about Trump's handling of the federal workforce related to his firings of top complaint system officials. The Court declined to quickly freeze the ruling, though they said the administration could return if lower courts moved too fast. This was a technical step in a long-running case that began in 2020 when a union challenged policies restricting what judges could say publicly. The decision comes after the Court has sided with the Trump administration about two dozen times on emergency docket issues.</div>

                        <div class="subtopic-description">The Court has sided with the Trump administration about two dozen times on emergency docket matters ranging from immigration to federal funding. On Friday December 13, a D.C. Circuit Court ruled 2-1 that Trump's firings of Merit Systems Protection Board member Cathy Harris and NLRB member Gwynne Wilcox were lawful, citing those agencies' "significant executive powers"—aligning with Chief Justice Roberts' guidance that Humphrey's Executor applies to agencies "that do not wield substantial executive power." This suggests the Court may be ready to further narrow or overturn the precedent entirely.</div>

                        <div class="subtopic-description">TIME Magazine (February 2025) documented "more than a dozen" reversals in Trump's first six weeks, noting "the sheer number reflects an administration moving much faster than usual." By November, U.S. News tallied Trump's "biggest policy reversals" including flip-flopping tariffs, federal layoffs among critical programs, and international student visa policy. Unlike his first term when mistakes led to "paralysis," this time it's "nip and tuck, here and there" (Timothy Naftali, Columbia). The Brookings regulatory tracker (updated Dec 3) monitors "significant regulatory and deregulatory changes," showing a pattern of rules being rescinded, delayed, or modified across environmental, health, and labor policy.</div>

                        <div class="subtopic-description">Elon Musk admitted at a February Cabinet meeting that DOGE "accidentally canceled very briefly" Ebola prevention funding. He told Cabinet officials about plans to cut $1 trillion from budgets and further cull staff, acknowledging: "We won't be perfect, but when we make a mistake, we'll fix it very quickly." However, those mistakes proved "costly and embarrassing" as cuts hit nuclear security, pandemic prevention, and veteran assistance. Current/former USAID officials questioned Musk's claim that Ebola funding was "fully restored." Trump also berated Fed Chair Jerome Powell on social media, calling him a "major loser," only to about-face days later insisting he had "no intention" of firing Powell after markets plunged.</div>

                        <div class="subtopic-description">As of April 16, 2025, Trump ordered 111 prior presidential orders revoked (all but five from Biden years) plus 14 modified. This "easily surpassed" Biden's record of 76 Trump order reversals in 2021 (American Presidency Project). Trump issued more presidential directives in his first days than any recent president in a full first 100 days. These "rounds of reversals by both Trump and Biden suggest the fragility of relying on Presidential directives to institutionalize core policy objectives." Trump referred to "emergency" in at least 45 separate orders in his first 100 days, using emergency powers to override customary legal procedures.</div>

                        <div class="subtopic-description">Snopes analysis (Dec 16) documented how Trump policies align with Project 2025 proposals across immigration, climate, civil service, and abortion. Heritage Foundation sent email mid-December planning to "work with the Trump administration" on latest proposals. Trump reinstated Schedule F to reclassify up to 50,000 career civil servants as at-will employees, withdrew from Paris Agreement (effective 2026), terminated American Climate Corps, declared "national energy emergency," and aligned with Project 2025's aggressive deregulatory agenda. This separates grassroots brand sentiment from institutional policy reach—"decline in self-identification does not erase a detailed governing playbook."</div>

CNN reported the administration is working on post-Maduro contingency plans, with critics drawing Iraq comparisons. Legal experts, human rights groups, and international bodies say the killings are illegal under US and international law. Colombian and Venezuelan governments accused the US of extrajudicial murder. The "double tap" strike killing survivors raises potential war crime charges that could haunt the administration.</div>

Tens of thousands of others resigned under Musk's pressure. USAID "hollowed out." Immigration courts fell from 700 to 600 judges with 3.4M case backlog. DOJ trained military lawyers without immigration backgrounds as temporary judges. The aggressive cuts and uncertainty are creating operational chaos across government, with reversals frequently needed when critical functions fail.</div>
