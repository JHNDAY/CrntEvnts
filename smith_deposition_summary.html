            <h2>Smith's Assessment of the Cases</h2>
            
            <div class="key-point">
                <h3>January 6 / Election Case</h3>
                <p>Smith testified that he believed the Special Counsel's Office had <strong>proof beyond a reasonable doubt</strong> that President Trump:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Engaged in a criminal scheme to overturn the results of the 2020 election</li>
                    <li>Attempted to interfere in the lawful transfer of power following the 2020 election</li>
                    <li>Had sufficient evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="quote">"We had a very strong case... if we went to trial we would prevail."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="key-point">
                <h3>Classified Documents Case</h3>
                <p>Smith testified that he believed there was <strong>proof beyond a reasonable doubt</strong> that President Trump:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Willfully retained highly classified documents after leaving office in January 2021</li>
                    <li>Kept classified materials at his Mar-a-Lago social club</li>
                    <li>Had sufficient evidence for conviction on charges related to unlawful possession of classified documents</li>

            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Prosecutorial Standards and Ethics</h2>
            
            <h3>Robert Jackson's Standards</h3>
            <p>Smith was asked about and agreed with principles from Attorney General Robert Jackson's famous 1940 speech on prosecutorial ethics, including:</p>
            
            <div class="quote">
                "The prosecutor has more control over life, liberty, and reputation than any other person in America."
            </div>
            
            <div class="quote">
                "The most dangerous power of the prosecutor: that he will pick people he thinks he should get, rather than pick cases that need to be prosecuted."
            </div>
            
            <div class="quote">
                "A prosecutor... seeks truth and not victims, who serves the law and not factional purposes, and who approaches his task with humility."
            </div>
            
            <p>Smith affirmed he tried to live up to these standards during his time as Special Counsel.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Decision-Making Process</h2>
            
            <div class="key-point">
                <h3>Open-Minded Investigation</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Smith testified there was a prospect he might not bring indictments when first appointed</li>
                    <li>He did not have a preconceived outcome when taking the job</li>
                    <li>His team engaged in continuous debate about whether charges were justified</li>
                    <li>Final decisions to indict were made shortly before seeking indictments</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="quote">"When I took this case, I did not know enough about the facts or the law to have a judgment about whether we should proceed in either case, both cases or neither case."</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Consultations with Attorney General</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Smith had several meetings with Attorney General Garland about both cases</li>
                <li>They discussed legal and factual issues</li>
                <li>The AG never told Smith he couldn't or shouldn't go forward</li>
                <li>The AG could have blocked the indictments but chose not to</li>
                <li>Smith regularly consulted with the Solicitor General</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Controversial Issues Addressed</h2>
            
            <h3>Congressional Toll Records</h3>
            <div class="highlight">
                <p><strong>Major Point of Contention:</strong> The committee raised serious concerns about the Special Counsel's Office obtaining toll records from Members of Congress without their knowledge.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The House and Senate have Speech or Debate Clause protections under the Constitution</li>
                    <li>Committee members argued the subpoenas violated these protections</li>
                    <li>Smith disagreed with this interpretation</li>
                    <li>The DOJ Inspector General's Office was involved in serving some subpoenas, raising conflict of interest concerns</li>
                    <li>Smith testified that under current practice, judges would be notified if subpoenas involved Members of Congress, but this was not done at the time</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Justice Manual and Public Statements</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Questions were raised about whether Smith's definitive statements about Trump's guilt violated Justice Manual provisions</li>
                <li>The Manual prohibits prosecutors from asserting guilt before a jury determination when a case is pending</li>
                <li>Smith argued this restriction no longer applied after the cases were dismissed</li>
                <li>His final report language was more definitive than Special Counsel Hur's or Mueller's reports</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Smith's Professional Background</h2>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>This deposition represents a significant moment in congressional oversight, with the former Special Counsel defending his prosecutorial decisions while navigating substantial legal restrictions on what he could disclose. The testimony reveals deep partisan divisions over the legitimacy of the investigations and prosecutions of President Trump, with fundamental disagreements about prosecutorial discretion, constitutional protections for Members of Congress, and the appropriate standards for public commentary by prosecutors about dismissed cases.</p>
